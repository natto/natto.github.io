    trying to understand the stats. can we replicate them?

    based on Figure 2:

with this, we've reproduced the bargraph values

the conclusions are based on t-tests for those values


This gives the first result (t_69 = 2.2, p = 0.030)

#+BEGIN_SRC R :session rkin :var dkin=kin :results output

I was first wondering whether using a binomial test would be more proper. e.g.,

#+BEGIN_SRC R :session rkin :var dkin=kin :results output
binom.test(44, n=70)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example

	Exact binomial test

data:  44 and 70 
number of successes = 44, number of trials = 70, p-value = 0.04139
alternative hypothesis: true probability of success is not equal to 0.5 
95 percent confidence interval:
 0.5047659 0.7411302 
sample estimates:
probability of success 
             0.6285714
#+end_example


To replicate the first case. That's fine and all. Then it occured to me that

DZ twins are essentially just identically aged-non-twins. They are actually collapsing across the MZ/DZ groups to get the results. Therefore, at best, we should look at the MZ group only.

The highest detection group (gray = emergency) would be

#+BEGIN_SRC R :session rkin :var dkin=kin :results output
binom.test(23, n=34)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example

	Exact binomial test

data:  23 and 34 
number of successes = 23, number of trials = 34, p-value = 0.05761
alternative hypothesis: true probability of success is not equal to 0.5 
95 percent confidence interval:
 0.4947347 0.8261166 
sample estimates:
probability of success 
             0.6764706
#+end_example

The graph is visually very impressive. The standard errors can be obtained from the t-test of say =t.test(c(rep(1, 21), rep(0, 13)), mu=0.5)= via =(0.7897572 - 0.4455369) * 100 / 3.92=, or 8.78.

For one then, the DZ gray bar is most suspect. The MZ may or may not pan out. It is better considered a group showing borderline significance above chance. Overall, it gives merit to the idea but I can't walk away convinced that this paper alone is enough to show it. Intruiging? Definitely.

*** Recall of rapidly presented random chess positions is a function of skill

**** background

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     A classical result in the study of expertise is that experts
are better than nonexperts at memorizing meaningful material from their domain of expertise, but lose their superiority when the material is randomized. This result was first obtained in the study of chess memory (Chase & Simon, 1973b; Jongman & Lemmens, cited in Vicente & De Groot, 1990) and has since been widely cited in cognitive psychology textbooks (see, e.g., Anderson, 1990;
Lesgold, 1988) and hailed as one of the cornerstones of the study of expertise (Saariluoma, 1989).

**** background information

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     Dansereau (1969), studying times of performance of mental arithmetic and related tasks, estimated that about 2 sec was needed to begin processing a chunk whose label was held in short-term memory, and only about 300 msec to transfer to short-term memory each successive element of the chunk. Intervals even shorter than 300 msec intervals are familiar from other experiments on the speed with which subjects can count down familiar lists (Landauer, 1962; Pierce & Karlin, 1957).

**** methods

     3 subjects!

     motivation

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     In the perception task, we ask chess players to reconstruct a chess position while it remains in plain view, and we use subjects' successive glances at the board as an index of chunking. The basic assumption is that, under the conditions of the experiment, the subject will encode only one chunk per glance while reconstructing the position.
     #+END_QUOTE

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     hypothesis that long pauses would correspond to boundaries between successive chunks, while short time intervals between pieces would indicate that the pieces belonged to the same chunk in memory. 
     #+END_QUOTE

**** results

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     from the within-glance relations, it appears that subjects are noticing the pawn structure, clusters of pieces of the same color, and attack and defense relations over small spatial distances. 
     #+END_QUOTE

     i.e., chunking is facilitated by spatial proximity. Not surprising, but speaks against the notion that if we have a master, they are chunking the board -- though, it could be possible, with a large enough repertoire. The point being that what's observed here is within expectation of skill mastery.

     from Chess Relations for Random Positions (table 3):

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     subjects are noticing the same kinds of structures in the random positions as in the game positions even though such structures are rare in the random positions.
     #+END_QUOTE
     
     i.e. the same chunking strategies are being used when confronted with an unfamiliar setup.

     Very nice: Figure 5 shows interpiece latencies vs. number of relations {A, P, C, S, D} between pairs.

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     For the middle-game positions, the average number of pieces per glance was 2.0, 2.8, and 2.0, respectively, for M, A, and B. For the memory experiment, however, the corresponding number of pieces per chunk was 2.5, 2.1, and 1.9, respectively. Thus, it appears that the chunks are about the same size in both tasks, but that chess skill is reflected in the speed with which chunks are perceived in the perception task and the size of the chunks in the memory task.
     #+END_QUOTE

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     M achieves his superior performance by recalling both more chunks and larger chunks.

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     The templates theory was implemented in a computer model—CHREST (Gobet & Jansen, 1994)—that contains a "mental eye," a short-term memory, and a long-term memory. The mental eye allows the formation of mental images, either from retina stimulation or from the activation of information in memory. The short-term memory is a vector with a capacity for 4 items, and the long-term memory contains a discrimination network in which chunks and templates are formed by means of familiarization and discrimination processes. This model has successfully simulated the performance of chess-players of different levels in memory tasks (Gobet & Simon, 2000), as well as the chess-players' eye-movements (De Groot & Gobet, 1996). It has also simulated problem-solving in computer programmers (Lane, Cheng, & Gobet, 2001) and language acquisition (Gobet et al., 2001)

     Nichelli and colleagues (1994) found brain activation in the left middle temporal lobe in a task that consisted of determining whether or not a move was legal. Onofrj et al. (1995) and Atherton, Zhuang, Bart, Hu, and Sheng (2003) studied chess-players who had to solve a chess problem while their brain activity was recorded. Onofrj et al. found brain activity in the nondominant superior frontal lobe and medial temporal lobe (that is, the right hemisphere in right-handed individuals and the left one in left-handed individuals). Atherton et al. found left hemisphere activation in the superior frontal lobe and cerebellum, and bilateral activation in the precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex. Lastly, Amizdic, Riehle, Fehr, Wienbruch, and Elbert, (2001) obtained brain images of chess-players while they played a game against a computer. They found a different distribution of brain activation in masters as compared with players of a lower level. The former showed a relatively more extended activation pattern in the frontal and parietal lobes than in medial temporal areas, whereas the lower level chess-players showed a relatively opposite distribution
     #+END_QUOTE

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     tasks requiring a greater cognitive demand, such as solving a chess problem or playing a game of chess, tend to activate frontal and parietal areas (Amizdic et al., 2001; Atherton et al., 2003; Onofrj et al., 1995). Conversely, tasks that require the mere retrieval of relevant information, such as chess rules, tend to activate temporal areas (Nichelli et al., 1994)
     #+END_QUOTE

     

**** method

     setup of the task is essentially a 1-back task. unfortunately there wasn't a "logically same" condition, which compares whether the trial condition is logically the same as the reference board (this would be tricky though; it would require something like 1. a logically same condition where all pieces are changed -- otherwise it would be the "identical" condition; 2. a rotation condition, with/without piece appearance changes, plus foil pieces such that a simple rotation would not sufficiently determine logical equality; then for 2. again, a contrast of mental rotation condition is a further requirement).

     for the novices, a legal vs. illegal chess board would not carry as much "meaning" as it would for experts. the setup using 1-back then is a contrast of *automatized vs non-automatized* processes. for the novices, since chessboard processing is *non-automatized*, the 1-back task results should display activations like a visual comparison task (as in a pure visual process), a short term memory task (as in what should be expected in a standard 1-back task regardless of stimulus modality), a visual search task (authors recognize the possibiilty of the delay period being a "visual review" in discussion), and to a small extent a LTM retrieval task (matching pieces to rules/roles, especially in the position-scene condition).

     anecdote on 2 master subjects on memorizing the geometric correspondence

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     The two masters commented to the experimenter that they easily memorized the correspondence of the geometric figures with chess pieces, and this was facilitated by the similarity between the figures and the pieces, and that during the experiment, they perceived the figures as if they were chess pieces.
     #+END_QUOTE

     unfortunately we can't tell how much the memorization of the correspondence was facilitated by the similarity of chess pieces. Though intuitively, maximal discruption could be achieved if we simply shuffled pieces for the mapping (e.g. Pawns to Rooks, Rooks to Kings, etc.). The interesting and unanswered case here is for a minimally disruptive but minimally informative mapping (say, blobs), how easy would the mapping be, and what happens on a correct mapping?

     A possibility if we use random blobs is there's a mental burden of recalling the blob -> piece correspondence, which should be shared across novices and experts as a simple paired-associate learning task. The question is whether expert LTM of spatial arrangements and logical positions actually facilitates remembering. But that would be similar to say, decoding ROT13 (or any substitution cipher) for an average English speaker. Thus I'd believe that the geometric similarity is highly important. So the reference to Chase and Simon (1973), where they used the initials of the pieces, probably still demonstrates domain specific memory.

     We directly compared the groups on the chess minus random chess contrast using a random-effects fMRI group analysis (uncorrected p < .001, 20 voxel minimum) (refer to Fig. 1B and C). Significant differences emerged with experts showing greater activation in the left orbitofrontal cortex (x = -4, y = 58, z = -2), in the left (x = -10, y = -50, z = 12) and right posterior cingulate (x = 14, y = -52, z = 2), and in the left anterior temporal cortex (x = -50, y = 8, z = -26). By contrast, the novices showed greater activation than experts in two distinct clusters in right parietal cortex (x = -32, y = -52, z = 40) and (x = -38, y = -54, z = 46).

     The seemingly across-the-board lower activation in the left FFA for experts compared to novices (also Right FFA, though probably visually insignificant) is very curious. I don't see this being addressed directly in the paper but definitely looks worth digging into.

     There was some differential activation of the left parietal cortex in novices over experts associated with real game chess processing. The parietal lobes have been associated with spatial processing previously [fn:campitelli2007], suggesting that this activation may have been related to a greater level of visual location search than occurred for the expert group. The left temporo-parietal junction showed evidence of chess modulation in experts. This is an area that has been associated with integration of visual features, thus providing the clearest evidence of a perceptually driven neural change related to chess expertise.

*** The valuation system: A coordinate-based meta-analysis of BOLD fMRI experiments examining neural correlates of subjective value.

    Bartra, McGuire, & Kable (2013)


    #+BEGIN_QUOTE
    Both primary and monetary incentives elicited SV responses in the same brain regions. This aspect of our results aligns with an emerging consensus that a unitary neural system, including regions of striatum and VMPFC, represents SV across different categories of goods (Chib et al., 2009; Kim et al., 2011; Levy and Glimcher, 2011, 2012). We found no evidence for regions that encoded primary rewards exclusively.

    The similarity of SV responses acrossmonetary and primary-reward outcomes is important because it suggests that a reward that is merely signaled (e.g., money) is evaluated similarly to one that is actually con-sumed (e.g., juice). This equivalence would not necessarily have been expected under a literal interpretation of standard economic models (Camerer et al., 2005)

*** Robust Hyperlinks Cost Just Five Words Each

    Thomas A Phelps & Robert Wilensky

    The takeaway is that a viable method for a robust hyperlink is by extracting the top 5 terms from TF-IDF. The interesting thing is this paper is from 2000, and uses Google, AltaVista, Yahoo, Hotbot, and Infoseek as test targets. At this point, the web is probably 100x as large, and only 2 of the 5 engines are of any relevance today, and have substantially smarter (and human-centric) algorithms behind them. Thus, even a robust hyperlink using 5 TF-IDF terms may not give the desired hit.

    A cursory search (< 1 minute) does not give anything recent which looks like immediate follow up work on this paper. The most amusing aspect now is that the "Robust Web Site" ( http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~phelps/Robust/ ) is now 404 at Berkeley.

    It would have been cute if the paper was actually titled something like "Robust Hyperlinks: Just Five Words".

*** Robust Intra-Document Locations

    Phelps et al

    This is the paper that describes the basic idea behind the MultiValent document viewer's "anchoring" method. It was very impressive when it was first demonstrated.

    The most interesting method of anchoring is the /Context submethod/, although it is not the most preferred method (the best is /Unique identifier/, then /Tree path/). The /Context/ method is most human-like, which means that as match quality degrades, the kinds of errors we see would be more like a human's context searching method.

    The algorithm given is the most straightforward heuristic:

    #+BEGIN_QUOTE
    the closest match to the original position is the preferred. A search is done forward and backward, with the nearer match chosen. If neither direction matches, more and more of the context is shed until a match is found, or until the length of the string used for the search drops below a threshold.

*** The Effect of Sleep Onset on Event Related Potentials With Rapid Rates of Stimulus Presentation

    de Lugt et al

**** background

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     A variety of sensory and cognitive evoked potentials have been recorded during actual sleep. The early latency exogenous potentials (typically those occurring within the first 10 ms following stimulus presentation) are unaltered (Amadeo and Shagass, 1973; Osterhammel et al., 1985; Campbell and Bartoli, 1986; Erwin and Buchwald, 1986; Deacon-Elliot et al., 1987; Bastuji et al., 1988) or show only relatively small changes during sleep (Stelmack et al., 1993).
     #+END_QUOTE

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     The auditory P1-N1-P2 'vertex' complex is the most frequently studied. N1, peaking between 75 and 150 ms, is greatly attenuated during NREM sleep (Näätänan and Picton, 1987; Campbell et al., 1988; Nielsen-Bohlman et al., 1991; Bastuji et al., 1995). The reduction in the amplitude of N1 has been found regardless of stimulus intensity, ranging from 60 to 100 dB (Campbell et al., 1988), or the inter stimulus interval (ISI), ranging from 1 to 12 s (Armitage et al., 1990). N1 (or subcomponents which overlap it in time and space) has also been found to vary with the subject's level of attention (Näätänan and Picton, 1987; Näätänan, 1990). At sleep onset, N1 gradually declines in amplitude (Noldy et al, 1988; Ogilvie et al., 1991; Bastuji et al., 1995), possibly due to a decrease in the subject's level of attention. The decrease in the amplitude of N1 is paralleled by a slowing of the behavioral reaction time (Noldy et al., 1988; Ogilvie et al., 1991).
     #+END_QUOTE     

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     It has been known for some time that it is exceedingly difficult to ignore stimuli that are presented slowly. For example, differences in the amplitude of P1-N1-P2 peak deflections due to manipulation of the subject's level of attention, become much smaller as the rate of stimulus presentation is slowed (Schwent et al., 1976; Näätänan, 1990). This may explain some of the inconsistencies in ERP results at sleep onset. Even when differences have been reported, they do not typically emerge until relatively late in the sleep onset period, perhaps because stimuli presented slowly intrude into conscious awareness, thus delaying sleep.
     #+END_QUOTE

**** methods

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     Single trial ERPs were sorted into five different sleep/wake stages: Alert Wakefulness (AW, the reading condition), Relaxed Wakefulness (RW, lights out with eyes closed), Stage 1 sleep (S1), Stage 2 sleep (S2), and Slow Wave Sleep (SWS, combined Stages 3 and 4 sleep). RW was defined by a predominance (>50%) of low voltage alpha EEG activity (8-12 Hz), and occasional rapid eye movements or blinking. S1 sleep was defined by relatively low voltage, mixed frequency EEG activity (2-7 Hz), and the presence of slow rolling eye movements (Rechtschaffen and Kales, 1968). Stages 2, 3 and 4 were also defined by the standard Rechtschaffen and Kales scoring criteria. Single trial ERPs were sorted and averaged within each sleep/wake stage. Data were then collapsed across all sleep onset periods.
     #+END_QUOTE

**** discussion

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     The finding that the progression from Alert Wakefulness to Slow Wave Sleep is associated with a gradual and significant reduction in the amplitude of the N1 confirms previous findings (Noldy et al., 1988; Nielsen-Bohlman et al., 1991; Ogilvie et al., 1991). N1 tended to invert in polarity at the mastoid during the waking and sleeping states. Thus, although N1 latency was prolonged during sleep onset, its scalp distribution suggests that the intracranial generators are similar in each condition. In addition, a parallel increase in the amplitude of P1 and P2 was observed. Thus, when peak-to-peak amplitudes (P1-N1 and N1-P2) were measured, no significant differences emerged. It is, therefore, not N1 per se that is affected by sleep onset. Rather, it would appear that a slow negative wave that overlaps the P1-N1-P2 waking waveform is removed at sleep onset.
     #+END_QUOTE

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     The essence of this argument appears to be centered on whether the subject is inhibiting processing during the sleep state or whether actively enhancing processing during the waking state. This controversy is similar to the one surrounding selective attention (see Näätänan, 1990): is there additional processing of the attended channel (reflected by the addition of a negative slow wave) or inhibition of processing of the unattended channel (reflected by the addition of a positive slow wave).
     #+END_QUOTE
     
     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     Stage 2 is used by many laboratories as point of sleep onset (Johnson, 1973; Salisbury et al., 1992). Stage 1 is considered to be a transition between the waking and sleeping states (Rechtschaffen and Kales, 1968; Ogilvie and Wilkinson, 1984; Ogilvie et al., 1991). This is because at least some subjects can make behavioral responses to external stimuli (presented at slow rates) during Stage 1 sleep
     #+END_QUOTE

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     Näätänan (1990) has suggested that N1 may act as a transient-detector system that triggers an internal attentional system. N1 may subserve 'conscious perception of auditory stimuli in general', and furthermore, 'without indicating what the stimulus is or what its precise features are' (p. 212).
     #+END_QUOTE

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     gradual decrement in N1 amplitude has also been observed during anesthetic-induced loss of consciousness (Plourde and Picton, 1991; van Hooff et al., 1995).

**** results

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     For the abacus experts, the numeral mental-operation task induced activity in the frontal operculum, superior precentral sulcus (SPcS), posterior parietal cortex including intraparietal sulcus areas (IPS), and posterior superior parietal cortex/precuneus, fusiform gyrus, and cerebellar hemisphere. This activity was bilaterally symmetrical. For the controls, the numeral mental-operation task activated the prefrontal cortex, Broca's area, medial frontal areas including the anterior cingulate cortex and presupplementary motor area (pre-SMA), and lateral parietal area. Nonexperts also showed activity in the areas observed during the numeral task for experts (i.e., frontal operculum, SPcS, IPS, posterior parietal cortex, fusiform gyrus, and cerebellar hemisphere); however, this calculation-related activity for controls was strongly lateralized to the left hemisphere. This pattern of activity during mental calculation was consistent with previous neuroimaging studies (de Jong et al., 1996; Dehaene et al., 1996; Rueckert et al., 1996; Burbaud et al., 1999; Rickard et al., 2000; Gruber et al., 2001; Pesenti et al., 2001; Zago et al., 2001).
     The spatial mental-operation task induced symmetrical bilateral activity of the frontal operculum, SPcS, IPS, posterior superior parietal cortex, precuneus, and visual association areas. This activity was very similar between the two groups; moreover, the activity in the premotor and parietal cortices during the spatial task for both groups was almost identical to that observed during mental calculation for experts. During the verbal mental-operation task, experts and nonexperts both exhibited activity primarily in the medial frontal areas (anterior cingulate cortex and pre-SMA), SPcS, lateral parietal areas, and IPS. This activity was predominantly in the left hemisphere in the two groups, although the experts tended to exhibit more activity of the right hemisphere.

This is consistent with an a priori hypothesis that enhanced motor imagery subserves mental arithmetic for abacus experts.

These differences were interpreted as reflecting more visuospatial/visuomotor imagery processing for mental calculation of abacus experts in comparison with nonexperts. Among these areas, the posterior superior parietal overactivity likely reflected spatial information processing in 2-dimensional space, which would be a characteristic of mental abacus operations.

*** Self-Control in Decision-Making Involves Modulation of the vmPFC Valuation System

    Todd A. Hare et al, /Science/ 2009

    4 main hypotheses

**** H1 vmPFC activity should correlate with S's goal values regardless of self-control

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     We tested the first prediction by estimating a general linear model (GLM) of blood oxygen level–dependent activity that included a parametric regressor for goal values at the time of evaluation. Activity in vmPFC was correlated with goal values for all participants regardless of the amount of self-control exercised (Fig. 2, A and B; fig. S1; and table S2). The areas of vmPFC identified largely overlap with regions that have been associated with valuation in other tasks that require no self-control (11–15) (Fig. 2C)
     #+END_QUOTE

**** H2 vmPFC activity should reflect health ratings for SC but NSC groups

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     To test the second prediction, we estimated a new GLMthat included parametric regressors for health and taste ratings. The beta values for both parametric regressors were extracted from the voxels in vmPFC that exhibited the strongest correlation with goal values for each participant. In the SC group, vmPFC activity was modulated by both health (t18 = 4.20,P< 0.001) and taste (t18= 3.31,P< 0.005) (Fig. 2D), whereas in the NSC group it was only modulated by taste (t17 = 7.28, P< 0.001). We tested this relationship further by estimating a linear regression of the impact of health ratings on each participant'sbehavioragainst a measure of the impact of health ratings on the participant's vmPFC activity (regression coefficient = 0.847,t35 =5.57,P< 0.001) (Fig. 2E)
     #+END_QUOTE

**** H3 DLPFC activation in self control trials > failed self-control trials

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     We tested the third prediction by comparing the neural responses during the decision period in three different types of trials: those in which self-control was not needed, those inwhich self-control was successfully deployed, and those in which participants failed to use self-control. We found greater left DLPFC activity [inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and Brodmann's area (BA) 9 (IGF/BA9)] in the SC group than in the NSC group during successful self-control trials (Fig. 3Aand table S3). However, both groups had greater activity in this region for successful self-control trials compared with that of failed self-control trials (SCgroupt14= 2.29, NSC groupt13 =2.62,P<0.05) (Fig.3B)
     #+END_QUOTE


**** H4 DLPFC and vmPFC should exhibit functional connectivity during self-control trials

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     We tested the fourth prediction by performing a linear regression of left DLPFC activity during self-control trials on the response of vmPFC to the presentation of liked-but-unhealthy food items (regression coefficient =–0.688,t17=–2.26;P< 0.05) (Fig. 3C). Self-control in this type of trial requires ramping down the weight given to taste in computing the goal value. A similar decrease in vmPFC activity was seen in gamblers who chose not to gamble in losing conditions (25).
     #+END_QUOTE

**** DLPFC may modulate vmPFC via IFG/BA46

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     This area was of particular interest because it is involved in working memory and goal maintenance (21, 22), it has anatomical connections to vmPFC (26), and pre-vious studies have shown that IFG/BA46 activity is correlated with goal values (11, 13)

     - McClure: vmPFC is shortsighted valuation system, DLPFC is system with foresight
     - Kable & Glimcher: vmPFC-strata is common valuation system regardless of self control

     this paper supports DLPFC as self control and not valuation.
       
     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     we show that this is not because an alternative value signal is encoded in DLPFC, which in our experiment would require a nonexistent correlation between activity in this area and the health ratings (fig. S5). Instead, the DLPFC influences self-control by modulating the value signal encoded in vmPFC.

      For the experts, the SSA task induced activation in the right lateral premotor cortex (LPMC) and bilateral posterior temporal areas. Activation was also observed in the left LPMC, but it did not reach significant level. The CSA task induced activation bilaterally in the LPMC, posterior superior parietal lobule (PSPL), and parahippocampal gyrus.
      #+END_QUOTE

***** non-experts

      #+BEGIN_QUOTE
      for the controls, simple and complex tasks induced almost the same activation areas. Activities were found in the bilateral inferior parietal lobule (LPi), left LPMC and right supplementary motor area (SMA) including the anterior cingulated cortex (ACC) in both SSA and CSA tasks. Moreover, significant activation was also found in the left inferior frontal gyrus (GFi) (BA 9, 45, 46) in CSA; and the region in LPi including HIPS extending anteriorly to the postcentral gyrus and laterally into the angular gyrus (AG). During CSA versus SSA task, both experts and controls showed activation areas primarily in the LPMC and PSPL (including the vicinity of precuneus). However, the occipital areas (BA 17, 18, 19) were significantly activated in experts while the GFi, ACC and cuneus showed increasing activation in controls. In auditory stimuli, the brain activation mapping closely corresponded to the similar activation in visual stimuli except that superior temporal cortices were significantly observed in CSA against SSA task contrast (Fig. 3). In this contrast, as Fig. 3 illustrated, there was no between-hemisphere difference in terms of the comparison of the peak activations obtained for both hemispheres in both stimuli.

*** Neural Bases of Selective Attention in Action Video Game Players

    D. Bavelier et al

**** background

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     It was first demonstrated that VGPs outperform NVGPs in selective attention by using the Useful Field of View (UFOV) paradigm initially developed by Ball and collaborators. This task requires subjects to distribute their attention widely over the screen and locate a peripheral target while ignoring irrelevant distractors (Feng, Spence, & Pratt, 2007; Green & Bavelier, 2003; Sekuler & Ball, 1986; Spence et al., 2009). Enhanced spatial selective attention in gamers has been shown more recently using different types of search tasks, such as the Swimmer task (West et al., 2008) or difficult visual search tasks (Hubert-Wallander, Green, & Bavelier, 2010; but see Castel, Pratt, & Drummond, 2005 for a different result)

     Under these high load conditions, VGPs and NVGPs similarly processed the attended streams, but VGPs more efficiently suppressed the unattended streams. Notably, this greater suppression was associated with faster reaction times. Greater distractor suppression may be a possible mechanism for more efficient executive and attentional control (Clapp et al., 2011 in older adults; Serences et al., 2004; Toepper et al., 2010)

In addition, increasing the search difficulty from the low to high load displays increased reaction times by about 70 ms in both VGPs and NVGPs indicating equal increase in difficulty from low to high load in the two populations compared.

A largely overlapping network of areas was observed to be functionally connected to the dorsal anterior cingulate and middle frontral gyrus in VGPs and NVGPs. These included, in addition to the two seed areas, the superior parietal cortex, the supra-marginal gyrus, the SMA, the pre-central gyrus, the insular cortex, and interestingly the anterior prefrontal cortex. Along with the superior parietal cortex, the insula and the pre-central gyrus, this anterior prefrontal area showed significantly greater connectivity with the anterior cingulate and the middle frontal gyrus in VGPs than in NVGPs

     In summary, the resultsof this study found that theexpert group showed more activation of the visual association cortex of the left occipital lobeandACCthanthenovicegroup. Inaddition, thenovice group showed higher activation of the frontal area than the expert group. Activation of the posterior cingulate gyrus and cerebellar tonsil was seen in novices but not in experts. In particular, BA 6 is known to plan complex and coordinated movements, while BA 7 plays a role in the converging the sense of vision and proprioception. Moreover, according to Gerardin et al.[ 12] and Grafton et al.[ 14], BA 44 and BA 45 are involved in behavior recognition, and these areas were activated in the novice group during the process of recognizing arrow shooting. Thus, for the experts in this experiment, their advanced experience, long-term practice, motor coordination, emotional regulation, and task adaptation appeared to result in less frontal cortical activity when challenged with specific task demands.

     same focus was found by Nakada et al. [fn:nakadaetal1998]. These authors compared the activation pattern associated with music score reading with that associated with language reading (English and Japanese). An area within the right occipital cortex (adjacent to the occipital sulcus) was identified as being specifically activated by reading music scores. However, the reading task used by the authors was again not clearly specified, and we are confronted with the same interpretative problem as mentioned for the Sergent study [fn:sergentetal1992]. Nonetheless, this region of the right occipital cortex seems to be important since Cappelletti's et al.

     we can look at a few analogous situations. a beginning golfer going through swinging motions first (kinesthetic, procedural), fire drills (likewise), reading a book's table of contents (mostly declarative). rhythm however, is almost completely temporal. indeed, the clapping motion is dissociated from the actual motions of playing a non-percussive instrument. the system we're seeding here should thus be a system that specializes in temporal understanding.

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     activity was observed within the DLPFC in response to instructions to name the color but not read the word. 
     #+END_QUOTE

     supposedly this is because reading color is the less automatized action, so DLPFC holds the rule that the "less-expected" action should be taken. In this way the top-down control hypothesis is consistent. But their main takeaway

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     DLPFC provides top-down support of task-appropriate behaviors, whereas other components, such as the ACC, are likely to be involved in evaluative processes indicating when control needs to be more strongly engaged.
     #+END_QUOTE

**** interpretation of dissociation of activity between DLPFC and ACC

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     This is consistent with a role in the implementation of control, by representing and actively maintaining the attentional demands of the task. In contrast, the ACC was selectively activated during the response period, more for incongruent than for congruent color-naming trials. This is consistent with a role in conflict monitoring

**** why the ACC is supposed to be distinct in this study

     their assumption:

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     Regions implementing control should be negatively correlated with the amount of conflict (i.e., more control, less conflict).
     #+END_QUOTE

     which is supported by:

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     This pattern was observed in the DLPFC, but the correlation between ACC activity and conflict was in a positive direction
     #+END_QUOTE

     the inference is fine, but should the assumption be? if it were prediction error, then the greater the conflict, the greater the region implementing control should activate (violation of expectation), such as in OFC in value judgment. taking time into account however, sure this makes sense. More control now, less conflict (error) later. But ACC activation occurs at the response phase, whereas DLFPC at the rule maintenace phase. So this assumption is ok but a bit lax.

     one subject could find rule encoding very difficult, expend a lot of energy on DLPFC activation, and suck at the stroop task afterwards, and experience conflict and increased ACC activation. Then we expect DLPFC up + ACC up in incongruence > congruence. A first vs. second half interaction analysis here would have been a good addition, as well as whether there was some kind of resource competition between the regions. The next interesting question is, assuming there is competition, how the delay period between first vs. second halves alters the response. That would be a cognitive load Stroop task. So, DLPFC up, something down, then ACC up...

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     ACC activity increases when top-down control is low, whether control is reduced from trial to trial or across a number of trials [fn:botvinicketal1999] [fn:carteretal2000]

     The effects of bizarre and interacting imagery on the acquistion and retrieval of 20 paired associates (PA) were examined using 30 young and 27 (out of 38) elderly who successfully learned the PAs to criterion. Interacting imagery facilitated acquisition, especially for the elderly, but did not benefit retrieval. There was no evidence that bizarre imageries were superior than logical ones in facilitating acquistion or retrieval. Furthermore, the elderly tended to resist using bizarre imagery, and both young and elderly subjects tended to use imagery that was more congruent with non-bizarre life experiences and events.

     #+END_QUOTE

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     Midazolam is a benzodiazepene that increases the binding of GABA to GABA-A receptors. Although GABA-A receptors are expressed throughout the brain, the GABA-A/benzodiazepene receptors are particularly densely expressed in the hippocampus, in far greater numbers than in striatum (Montpied et al., 1988). It has been shown that midazolam increases inhibitory currents in the CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus (Kobayashi et al., 2004; Kristiansen & Lambert, 1996; Poncer et al., 1996; Rovira & Ben-Ari, 1993) and inhibits hippocampal long-term potentiation (Evans & Viola-McCabe, 1996). In addition, various lines of evidence suggest that midazolam impairs hippocampal-dependent explicit memory processes, while sparing other forms of memory (Arndt, Passannante, & Hirshman, 2004; Hirshman, Fisher, Henthorn, Arndt, & Passannante, 2002; Hirshman et al., 2001; Park et al., 2004; Thomas-Anterion et al., 1999). Positron emission tomography studies have shown that midazolam decreases blood flow to the hippocampus and left prefrontal cortex, which interact with each other in explicit memory and reasoning processes, and that midazolam has no effect on striatal areas (Bagary et al., 2000; Reinsel et al., 2000).

     neuroimaging studies show that the hippocampus is activated more by conjunctive items that have been studied together than by two individually studied items that are recombined (Giovanello, Schnyer, & Verfaeillie, 2004), suggesting that it is more involved in binding elements together than in flexibly recombining them.

**** transitive inference task

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     four pairs are presented: A+B-, B+C-, C+D-, and D+E- (the plus and minus signs indicate the reinforced and nonreinforced choice, respectively). After learning the correct choices, participants are presented with the novel test pairs AE and BD. Successful AE performance is trivial, because A was always reinforced during training, and E was never reinforced. In contrast, because B and D were reinforced equally often during training, the selection of B over D is taken to indicate that an inference has been made

**** /conjuctive/ and /elemental/ representations

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     The hippocampus supports explicit memorization of the conjunction of each stimulus pair (AB, BC, etc.) by automatically and rapidly binding together individual elements of the event (Atallah, Frank, & O'Reilly, 2004; Davachi & Wagner, 2002; Frank et al., 2003; O'Reilly & Rudy, 2001). In parallel, the basal ganglia–dopamine system learns an implicit elemental reinforcement value for each stimulus depending on how often its selection is associated with positive versus negative reinforcement (Frank, 2005; Frank, Rudy, et al., 2005; Frank et al., 2004). 
     #+END_QUOTE

***** learning relative valuations and performing comparitive judgments without logic and declarative memory

      #+BEGIN_QUOTE
      participants may choose B over D simply because B has a higher dopamine reinforcement value; they do not have to explicitly perform any logical reasoning. This mechanism explains why participants can respond transitively even when they are prevented from becoming explicitly aware of logical structure (Frank, Rudy, et al., 2005; Greene, Spellman, Dusek, Eichenbaum, & Levy, 2001) and is consistent with the effects of dopaminergic manipulation on learning in a TI task (Frank et al., 2004).

**** probabilistic selection task

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     In 80% of AB trials, a choice of stimulus A leads to positive feedback and a choice of B leads to negative feedback (feedback is reversed for the remaining 20% of trials). Stimulus C is correct in 70% of CD trials, and E is correct in 60% of EF trials. Over the course of training, participants learn to choose stimuli A, C, and E more often than B, D, or F. 
     #+END_QUOTE

     this is in other words a multi-armed bandit task with the same uniform distribution, but different mean values, on each arm, presented iteratively in pairs. It is interesting that they suggest that subjects choose the "correct" arms ~more often~ instead of deterministically selecting the higher-valued arm.

**** results

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     results are consistent with the proposals that (a) midazolam impairs explicit memory processes that depend on the hippocampus, (b) the hippocampus is not necessary and actually hinders transitive responding in associative learning tasks. and (c) the hippocampus is not critically involved in probabilistic learning. 
     #+END_QUOTE

***** A superbly written section on the reasoning for the ANOVA analysis

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     Our hypothesis that the hippocampus is important for rapidly memorizing stimulus conjunctions leads to additional predictions for learning patterns during the training phases of both tasks. In the TI task, the anchor pairs AB and DE are the easiest to learn because stimulus A is always correct and stimulus E is always incorrect. The middle pairs (BC and CD) are more difficult and may benefit from explicit memorization of stimulus conjunctions to prevent interference. We hypothesized that midazolam should impair memorization of stimulus conjunctions and would be associated with worse performance on the middle pairs than in the saline condition. In contrast, the tendency for participants to rely on reinforcement learning systems under midazolam was expected to lead to better performance on the anchor pairs than in the saline condition. We further hypothesized that these effects would be apparent very early in training, given the known role of the hippocampus in automatically and rapidly encoding stimulus conjunctions in very few trials (O'Reilly & Rudy, 2001). After multiple training trials, the differential reinforcement values learned for stimulus items A through E should be sufficient for good performance on all pairs.
     #+END_QUOTE

      #+BEGIN_QUOTE
      results support the hypothesis that midazolam administration leads to increased reliance on reinforcement learning about individual stimuli (as evidenced by better anchor-pair performance than in the saline condition), together with reduced ability to rapidly bind together stimulus elements into conjunctive pairs (as evidenced by impaired middle-pair performance).

**** =Ullman's differential hypothesis= is not well-supported

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     A recent theory claims that the processing of L2 acquired late in life depends upon different cognitive mechanisms and cerebral structures from L1 [fn:ullman2001]. Following this view, grammatical knowledge for L2 is declarative rather than implicit, as is the case for L1 grammar. By contrast, lexical knowledge is represented in the declarative memory system for both L1 and L2. Because implicit and declarative knowledge are mediated by distinct neural systems (a left frontal-basal ganglia circuit for implicit knowledge and left temporal language areas for declarative knowledge), Ullman's differential hypothesis claims that L2 acquisition in adulthood could not depend on the same brain mechanisms that are used to process the native language [fn:ullman2001].

One might argue this is a one-time cost, which is true, but the real utility of a mnemonic system should be a highly versatile set of tools that one can employ nearly on-the-fly, as needed. Levin also addresses this somewhat, in the Grade B section, i.e., how the burden is placed too heavily on students (to use their own creativity, varying levels of effectiveness from learning curves etc.), but that's part of the whole issue.

     positive-affect index increases monotonically for all groups, significant only for loser group. Also, max. affect for losers (on $5) is less than min. affect for winners (on $3).

***** TODO paste figures?

**** experiment 2

     29 (after 2 exclusions) people, probably not pedestrians but lab participants, completed 4 rounds of 2-alternative forced choices by this matrix of combinations:

     | digits \ payoff | $5           | $3          |
     |               8 | highN, high$ | lowN, high$ |
     |               2 | lowN, high$  | lowN, low$  |
     
All choices are lose trials, i.e., if payoff is $5, you were at the end shown the other choice would have been >$5; probably $7. Also note they had a $5 participation fee.

digits are to be memorized during choice, acts as cognitive load manipulation. Prediction is high load saps cognitive resources so relative comparision (against higher value alternative) is harder, thus happiness across high vs. low in high-load conditions should be similar, but in low load it should be higher for high payoff.

Looks like affect was measured after every choice, thus there are =4 * 29 = 116= data points, which they do repeated measures ANOVA on. Figure 2 is fairly clear. The significances are all 0.05 range, the interaction of =load*amount= is 0.08. I guess we can expect a fairly good fit if we fit a plane in 3d if a bunch of (win value, lose value, affect) values were given.

   3d graphics was not going to be sustainable as a accelerator, or fixed function device, that renders texture maps and polygons on the screen.

   we had to change the company to make the 3d graphics processors programmable to be an artistic medium of expression

   the crossing from one generation of technology to the next generation almost killed the company

** dying at the rate of Moore's Law

   when you're in a technology industry, when the technology moves this fast, the if you're not reinventing yourself, you're just slowly dying, unfortunately, at the rate of Moore's Law.

** cannibalizing your own products

   so we have a product that's generating a lot of money, and it's very successful, how do you cannibalize it?

** developing a tolerance for failure

   I don't believe you can fundamentally say that you want, as a CEO, to nurture the spirit of innovation, to encourage innovation, unless you have a culture of risk taking

   we have to encourage our engineers, our marketing people, all of our employees, to take calculated risks. In order to encourage them to take calculated risks, first of all you have to teach them. that's a skill. a matter of skill. then the second part is a matter of courage.

   

** you must keep reinventing the company

   the biggest challenge with building a company is the reinvention of the company.

   every successful thing needs to be torn down at some point and be rebuilt. it
   is unfortunate but true. and the reason for that is because the technology
   either gets good enough, and therefore you have to reinvent. and sometimes the
   invention process is disruptive. sometimes it is in fact destructive. it could
   destroy what you have built in the past.

** as the ceo

   you're either making money, saving money, or raising money

   

** the definition of a startup

   as a startup you're always going out of business. that's the definition of a startup! an enterprise that is nearly out of business all the time.
