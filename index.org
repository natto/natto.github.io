This gives the first result (t_69 = 2.2, p = 0.030)

I was first wondering whether using a binomial test would be more proper. e.g.,

#+BEGIN_SRC R :session rkin :var dkin=kin :results output
binom.test(44, n=70)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example

	Exact binomial test

data:  44 and 70 
number of successes = 44, number of trials = 70, p-value = 0.04139
alternative hypothesis: true probability of success is not equal to 0.5 
95 percent confidence interval:
 0.5047659 0.7411302 
sample estimates:
probability of success 
             0.6285714
#+end_example


To replicate the first case. That's fine and all. Then it occured to me that

DZ twins are essentially just identically aged-non-twins. They are actually collapsing across the MZ/DZ groups to get the results. Therefore, at best, we should look at the MZ group only.

The highest detection group (gray = emergency) would be

#+BEGIN_SRC R :session rkin :var dkin=kin :results output
binom.test(23, n=34)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example

	Exact binomial test

data:  23 and 34 
number of successes = 23, number of trials = 34, p-value = 0.05761
alternative hypothesis: true probability of success is not equal to 0.5 
95 percent confidence interval:
 0.4947347 0.8261166 
sample estimates:
probability of success 
             0.6764706
#+end_example

The graph is visually very impressive. The standard errors can be obtained from the t-test of say =t.test(c(rep(1, 21), rep(0, 13)), mu=0.5)= via =(0.7897572 - 0.4455369) * 100 / 3.92=, or 8.78.

For one then, the DZ gray bar is most suspect. The MZ may or may not pan out. It is better considered a group showing borderline significance above chance. Overall, it gives merit to the idea but I can't walk away convinced that this paper alone is enough to show it. Intruiging? Definitely.

*** Recall of rapidly presented random chess positions is a function of skill

**** background

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     A classical result in the study of expertise is that experts
are better than nonexperts at memorizing meaningful material from their domain of expertise, but lose their superiority when the material is randomized. This result was first obtained in the study of chess memory (Chase & Simon, 1973b; Jongman & Lemmens, cited in Vicente & De Groot, 1990) and has since been widely cited in cognitive psychology textbooks (see, e.g., Anderson, 1990;
Lesgold, 1988) and hailed as one of the cornerstones of the study of expertise (Saariluoma, 1989).

**** background information

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     Dansereau (1969), studying times of performance of mental arithmetic and related tasks, estimated that about 2 sec was needed to begin processing a chunk whose label was held in short-term memory, and only about 300 msec to transfer to short-term memory each successive element of the chunk. Intervals even shorter than 300 msec intervals are familiar from other experiments on the speed with which subjects can count down familiar lists (Landauer, 1962; Pierce & Karlin, 1957). 
     #+END_QUOTE


**** methods

     3 subjects!

     motivation

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     In the perception task, we ask chess players to reconstruct a chess position while it remains in plain view, and we use subjects' successive glances at the board as an index of chunking. The basic assumption is that, under the conditions of the experiment, the subject will encode only one chunk per glance while reconstructing the position.
     #+END_QUOTE

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     hypothesis that long pauses would correspond to boundaries between successive chunks, while short time intervals between pieces would indicate that the pieces belonged to the same chunk in memory. 
     #+END_QUOTE

**** results

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     from the within-glance relations, it appears that subjects are noticing the pawn structure, clusters of pieces of the same color, and attack and defense relations over small spatial distances. 
     #+END_QUOTE

     i.e., chunking is facilitated by spatial proximity. Not surprising, but speaks against the notion that if we have a master, they are chunking the board -- though, it could be possible, with a large enough repertoire. The point being that what's observed here is within expectation of skill mastery.

     from Chess Relations for Random Positions (table 3):

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     subjects are noticing the same kinds of structures in the random positions as in the game positions even though such structures are rare in the random positions.
     #+END_QUOTE
     
     i.e. the same chunking strategies are being used when confronted with an unfamiliar setup.

     Very nice: Figure 5 shows interpiece latencies vs. number of relations {A, P, C, S, D} between pairs.

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     For the middle-game positions, the average number of pieces per glance was 2.0, 2.8, and 2.0, respectively, for M, A, and B. For the memory experiment, however, the corresponding number of pieces per chunk was 2.5, 2.1, and 1.9, respectively. Thus, it appears that the chunks are about the same size in both tasks, but that chess skill is reflected in the speed with which chunks are perceived in the perception task and the size of the chunks in the memory task.
     #+END_QUOTE

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     M achieves his superior performance by recalling both more chunks and larger chunks.
     #+END_QUOTE

     (chunks are identified by "two or more pieces within 2 sec")

     The general estimate of the vocabulary size for the master subject is something around a half dozen classic / stereotyped positions.

     that is citing Chase and Simon (1973)

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     The templates theory was implemented in a computer model—CHREST (Gobet & Jansen, 1994)—that contains a "mental eye," a short-term memory, and a long-term memory. The mental eye allows the formation of mental images, either from retina stimulation or from the activation of information in memory. The short-term memory is a vector with a capacity for 4 items, and the long-term memory contains a discrimination network in which chunks and templates are formed by means of familiarization and discrimination processes. This model has successfully simulated the performance of chess-players of different levels in memory tasks (Gobet & Simon, 2000), as well as the chess-players' eye-movements (De Groot & Gobet, 1996). It has also simulated problem-solving in computer programmers (Lane, Cheng, & Gobet, 2001) and language acquisition (Gobet et al., 2001)

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     Nichelli and colleagues (1994) found brain activation in the left middle temporal lobe in a task that consisted of determining whether or not a move was legal. Onofrj et al. (1995) and Atherton, Zhuang, Bart, Hu, and Sheng (2003) studied chess-players who had to solve a chess problem while their brain activity was recorded. Onofrj et al. found brain activity in the nondominant superior frontal lobe and medial temporal lobe (that is, the right hemisphere in right-handed individuals and the left one in left-handed individuals). Atherton et al. found left hemisphere activation in the superior frontal lobe and cerebellum, and bilateral activation in the precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex. Lastly, Amizdic, Riehle, Fehr, Wienbruch, and Elbert, (2001) obtained brain images of chess-players while they played a game against a computer. They found a different distribution of brain activation in masters as compared with players of a lower level. The former showed a relatively more extended activation pattern in the frontal and parietal lobes than in medial temporal areas, whereas the lower level chess-players showed a relatively opposite distribution
     #+END_QUOTE

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     tasks requiring a greater cognitive demand, such as solving a chess problem or playing a game of chess, tend to activate frontal and parietal areas (Amizdic et al., 2001; Atherton et al., 2003; Onofrj et al., 1995). Conversely, tasks that require the mere retrieval of relevant information, such as chess rules, tend to activate temporal areas (Nichelli et al., 1994)
     #+END_QUOTE

     

**** method

     setup of the task is essentially a 1-back task. unfortunately there wasn't a "logically same" condition, which compares whether the trial condition is logically the same as the reference board (this would be tricky though; it would require something like 1. a logically same condition where all pieces are changed -- otherwise it would be the "identical" condition; 2. a rotation condition, with/without piece appearance changes, plus foil pieces such that a simple rotation would not sufficiently determine logical equality; then for 2. again, a contrast of mental rotation condition is a further requirement).

     for the novices, a legal vs. illegal chess board would not carry as much "meaning" as it would for experts. the setup using 1-back then is a contrast of *automatized vs non-automatized* processes. for the novices, since chessboard processing is *non-automatized*, the 1-back task results should display activations like a visual comparison task (as in a pure visual process), a short term memory task (as in what should be expected in a standard 1-back task regardless of stimulus modality), a visual search task (authors recognize the possibiilty of the delay period being a "visual review" in discussion), and to a small extent a LTM retrieval task (matching pieces to rules/roles, especially in the position-scene condition).

     anecdote on 2 master subjects on memorizing the geometric correspondence

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     The two masters commented to the experimenter that they easily memorized the correspondence of the geometric figures with chess pieces, and this was facilitated by the similarity between the figures and the pieces, and that during the experiment, they perceived the figures as if they were chess pieces.
     #+END_QUOTE

     unfortunately we can't tell how much the memorization of the correspondence was facilitated by the similarity of chess pieces. Though intuitively, maximal discruption could be achieved if we simply shuffled pieces for the mapping (e.g. Pawns to Rooks, Rooks to Kings, etc.). The interesting and unanswered case here is for a minimally disruptive but minimally informative mapping (say, blobs), how easy would the mapping be, and what happens on a correct mapping?

     A possibility if we use random blobs is there's a mental burden of recalling the blob -> piece correspondence, which should be shared across novices and experts as a simple paired-associate learning task. The question is whether expert LTM of spatial arrangements and logical positions actually facilitates remembering. But that would be similar to say, decoding ROT13 (or any substitution cipher) for an average English speaker. Thus I'd believe that the geometric similarity is highly important. So the reference to Chase and Simon (1973), where they used the initials of the pieces, probably still demonstrates domain specific memory.
     
     regarding result of "brain activation in frontal areas of the novices but not in the masters":
     
     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     the masters' familiarity with the chess symbols resulted in their not generating any additional processing demand
     #+END_QUOTE

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
      in contrast to the masters, the novices require high activation in frontal areas in the chess position condition, which suggests a switch in the masters' type of processing, from anterior to posterior areas of the brain.

     These subjects ranked within the top one percent of tournament players (five International Masters, one Grandmaster). Their expertise was substantiated by their com-petitive ratings (Elo range = 2447–2583; M = 2515), years playing (M = 16 years), and tournament activity (M = 17 per year)

     The years playing is a potentially interesting confound; the mean age of participants here is 23; for the expert level subjects then the mean start age is around 7 years old. We should expect substantial plasticity during this age and resulting cortical reorganization that cannot be observed from training adults for the same duration.

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     The experts indicated that they could perceive all or most of the chess boards within 2 s. Several reported that random chess was more difficult to perceive than real chess. Novices reported that they could rarely perceive all of the pieces and none reported that they were aware that the random games were impossible according to the rules of chess, a distinction all experts readily reported.
     #+END_QUOTE

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     The only significant group difference was that experts (M = 97.92%, SD = 3.23) were more accurate at detecting repeats of chess boards than novices (M = 87.50%, SD = 13.69).
     #+END_QUOTE

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     We directly compared the groups on the chess minus random chess contrast using a random-effects fMRI group analysis (uncorrected p < .001, 20 voxel minimum) (refer to Fig. 1B and C). Significant differences emerged with experts showing greater activation in the left orbitofrontal cortex (x = -4, y = 58, z = -2), in the left (x = -10, y = -50, z = 12) and right posterior cingulate (x = 14, y = -52, z = 2), and in the left anterior temporal cortex (x = -50, y = 8, z = -26). By contrast, the novices showed greater activation than experts in two distinct clusters in right parietal cortex (x = -32, y = -52, z = 40) and (x = -38, y = -54, z = 46).

     There was some differential activation of the left parietal cortex in novices over experts associated with real game chess processing. The parietal lobes have been associated with spatial processing previously [fn:campitelli2007], suggesting that this activation may have been related to a greater level of visual location search than occurred for the expert group. The left temporo-parietal junction showed evidence of chess modulation in experts. This is an area that has been associated with integration of visual features, thus providing the clearest evidence of a perceptually driven neural change related to chess expertise.

*** The valuation system: A coordinate-based meta-analysis of BOLD fMRI experiments examining neural correlates of subjective value.

    Bartra, McGuire, & Kable (2013)


    #+BEGIN_QUOTE
    Both primary and monetary incentives elicited SV responses in the same brain regions. This aspect of our results aligns with an emerging consensus that a unitary neural system, including regions of striatum and VMPFC, represents SV across different categories of goods (Chib et al., 2009; Kim et al., 2011; Levy and Glimcher, 2011, 2012). We found no evidence for regions that encoded primary rewards exclusively.

    The similarity of SV responses acrossmonetary and primary-reward outcomes is important because it suggests that a reward that is merely signaled (e.g., money) is evaluated similarly to one that is actually con-sumed (e.g., juice). This equivalence would not necessarily have been expected under a literal interpretation of standard economic models (Camerer et al., 2005)

*** Robust Hyperlinks Cost Just Five Words Each

    Thomas A Phelps & Robert Wilensky

    The takeaway is that a viable method for a robust hyperlink is by extracting the top 5 terms from TF-IDF. The interesting thing is this paper is from 2000, and uses Google, AltaVista, Yahoo, Hotbot, and Infoseek as test targets. At this point, the web is probably 100x as large, and only 2 of the 5 engines are of any relevance today, and have substantially smarter (and human-centric) algorithms behind them. Thus, even a robust hyperlink using 5 TF-IDF terms may not give the desired hit.

    A cursory search (< 1 minute) does not give anything recent which looks like immediate follow up work on this paper. The most amusing aspect now is that the "Robust Web Site" ( http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~phelps/Robust/ ) is now 404 at Berkeley.

    It would have been cute if the paper was actually titled something like "Robust Hyperlinks: Just Five Words".

*** Robust Intra-Document Locations

    Phelps et al

    This is the paper that describes the basic idea behind the MultiValent document viewer's "anchoring" method. It was very impressive when it was first demonstrated.

    The most interesting method of anchoring is the /Context submethod/, although it is not the most preferred method (the best is /Unique identifier/, then /Tree path/). The /Context/ method is most human-like, which means that as match quality degrades, the kinds of errors we see would be more like a human's context searching method.

    The algorithm given is the most straightforward heuristic:

    #+BEGIN_QUOTE
    the closest match to the original position is the preferred. A search is done forward and backward, with the nearer match chosen. If neither direction matches, more and more of the context is shed until a match is found, or until the length of the string used for the search drops below a threshold.

*** The Effect of Sleep Onset on Event Related Potentials With Rapid Rates of Stimulus Presentation

    de Lugt et al

**** background

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     A variety of sensory and cognitive evoked potentials have been recorded during actual sleep. The early latency exogenous potentials (typically those occurring within the first 10 ms following stimulus presentation) are unaltered (Amadeo and Shagass, 1973; Osterhammel et al., 1985; Campbell and Bartoli, 1986; Erwin and Buchwald, 1986; Deacon-Elliot et al., 1987; Bastuji et al., 1988) or show only relatively small changes during sleep (Stelmack et al., 1993).
     #+END_QUOTE

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     The auditory P1-N1-P2 'vertex' complex is the most frequently studied. N1, peaking between 75 and 150 ms, is greatly attenuated during NREM sleep (Näätänan and Picton, 1987; Campbell et al., 1988; Nielsen-Bohlman et al., 1991; Bastuji et al., 1995). The reduction in the amplitude of N1 has been found regardless of stimulus intensity, ranging from 60 to 100 dB (Campbell et al., 1988), or the inter stimulus interval (ISI), ranging from 1 to 12 s (Armitage et al., 1990). N1 (or subcomponents which overlap it in time and space) has also been found to vary with the subject's level of attention (Näätänan and Picton, 1987; Näätänan, 1990). At sleep onset, N1 gradually declines in amplitude (Noldy et al, 1988; Ogilvie et al., 1991; Bastuji et al., 1995), possibly due to a decrease in the subject's level of attention. The decrease in the amplitude of N1 is paralleled by a slowing of the behavioral reaction time (Noldy et al., 1988; Ogilvie et al., 1991).
     #+END_QUOTE     

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     It has been known for some time that it is exceedingly difficult to ignore stimuli that are presented slowly. For example, differences in the amplitude of P1-N1-P2 peak deflections due to manipulation of the subject's level of attention, become much smaller as the rate of stimulus presentation is slowed (Schwent et al., 1976; Näätänan, 1990). This may explain some of the inconsistencies in ERP results at sleep onset. Even when differences have been reported, they do not typically emerge until relatively late in the sleep onset period, perhaps because stimuli presented slowly intrude into conscious awareness, thus delaying sleep.
     #+END_QUOTE

**** methods

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     Single trial ERPs were sorted into five different sleep/wake stages: Alert Wakefulness (AW, the reading condition), Relaxed Wakefulness (RW, lights out with eyes closed), Stage 1 sleep (S1), Stage 2 sleep (S2), and Slow Wave Sleep (SWS, combined Stages 3 and 4 sleep). RW was defined by a predominance (>50%) of low voltage alpha EEG activity (8-12 Hz), and occasional rapid eye movements or blinking. S1 sleep was defined by relatively low voltage, mixed frequency EEG activity (2-7 Hz), and the presence of slow rolling eye movements (Rechtschaffen and Kales, 1968). Stages 2, 3 and 4 were also defined by the standard Rechtschaffen and Kales scoring criteria. Single trial ERPs were sorted and averaged within each sleep/wake stage. Data were then collapsed across all sleep onset periods.
     #+END_QUOTE

**** discussion

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     The finding that the progression from Alert Wakefulness to Slow Wave Sleep is associated with a gradual and significant reduction in the amplitude of the N1 confirms previous findings (Noldy et al., 1988; Nielsen-Bohlman et al., 1991; Ogilvie et al., 1991). N1 tended to invert in polarity at the mastoid during the waking and sleeping states. Thus, although N1 latency was prolonged during sleep onset, its scalp distribution suggests that the intracranial generators are similar in each condition. In addition, a parallel increase in the amplitude of P1 and P2 was observed. Thus, when peak-to-peak amplitudes (P1-N1 and N1-P2) were measured, no significant differences emerged. It is, therefore, not N1 per se that is affected by sleep onset. Rather, it would appear that a slow negative wave that overlaps the P1-N1-P2 waking waveform is removed at sleep onset.
     #+END_QUOTE

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     The essence of this argument appears to be centered on whether the subject is inhibiting processing during the sleep state or whether actively enhancing processing during the waking state. This controversy is similar to the one surrounding selective attention (see Näätänan, 1990): is there additional processing of the attended channel (reflected by the addition of a negative slow wave) or inhibition of processing of the unattended channel (reflected by the addition of a positive slow wave).
     #+END_QUOTE
     
     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     Stage 2 is used by many laboratories as point of sleep onset (Johnson, 1973; Salisbury et al., 1992). Stage 1 is considered to be a transition between the waking and sleeping states (Rechtschaffen and Kales, 1968; Ogilvie and Wilkinson, 1984; Ogilvie et al., 1991). This is because at least some subjects can make behavioral responses to external stimuli (presented at slow rates) during Stage 1 sleep
     #+END_QUOTE

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     Näätänan (1990) has suggested that N1 may act as a transient-detector system that triggers an internal attentional system. N1 may subserve 'conscious perception of auditory stimuli in general', and furthermore, 'without indicating what the stimulus is or what its precise features are' (p. 212).
     #+END_QUOTE

     gradual decrement in N1 amplitude has also been observed during anesthetic-induced loss of consciousness (Plourde and Picton, 1991; van Hooff et al., 1995).

     #+END_QUOTE

**** results

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     For the abacus experts, the numeral mental-operation task induced activity in the frontal operculum, superior precentral sulcus (SPcS), posterior parietal cortex including intraparietal sulcus areas (IPS), and posterior superior parietal cortex/precuneus, fusiform gyrus, and cerebellar hemisphere. This activity was bilaterally symmetrical. For the controls, the numeral mental-operation task activated the prefrontal cortex, Broca's area, medial frontal areas including the anterior cingulate cortex and presupplementary motor area (pre-SMA), and lateral parietal area. Nonexperts also showed activity in the areas observed during the numeral task for experts (i.e., frontal operculum, SPcS, IPS, posterior parietal cortex, fusiform gyrus, and cerebellar hemisphere); however, this calculation-related activity for controls was strongly lateralized to the left hemisphere. This pattern of activity during mental calculation was consistent with previous neuroimaging studies (de Jong et al., 1996; Dehaene et al., 1996; Rueckert et al., 1996; Burbaud et al., 1999; Rickard et al., 2000; Gruber et al., 2001; Pesenti et al., 2001; Zago et al., 2001).
     The spatial mental-operation task induced symmetrical bilateral activity of the frontal operculum, SPcS, IPS, posterior superior parietal cortex, precuneus, and visual association areas. This activity was very similar between the two groups; moreover, the activity in the premotor and parietal cortices during the spatial task for both groups was almost identical to that observed during mental calculation for experts. During the verbal mental-operation task, experts and nonexperts both exhibited activity primarily in the medial frontal areas (anterior cingulate cortex and pre-SMA), SPcS, lateral parietal areas, and IPS. This activity was predominantly in the left hemisphere in the two groups, although the experts tended to exhibit more activity of the right hemisphere.

      Formisano and colleagues (Formisano et al., 2002) reported neuroimaging findings that indicate functional segregation between the left and right parietal cortices.

      #+BEGIN_QUOTE
      Judging from this property and anatomic location, this parietal subdivision might correspond to the parietal area V6a in nonhuman primates (Rosa and Tweedale, 2001). It is suggested that, as opposed to object-motion detected by V5, V6a functions to detect self-motion. This is consistent with an a priori hypothesis that enhanced motor imagery subserves mental arithmetic for abacus experts. Area V6a also has a putative role in directing skeletomotor activity to extrapersonal space, which again requires vector-type computation.

***** Frontal cortex

      #+BEGIN_QUOTE
      SPcS and posterior superior parietal regions seem to conjointly function in both nonmotor mental operations and visuomotor control. This may explain the fact that simultaneous performance of motor tasks interferes with mental abacus operations (Stigler, 1984), which may most vividly characterize the difference between abacus and nonabacus calculation strategies.

      activity during mental calculation of abacus experts was characterized by overactivity in the posterior superior parietal cortex/precuneus and more involvement of frontoparietal areas in the right hemisphere. These differences were interpreted as reflecting more visuospatial/visuomotor imagery processing for mental calculation of abacus experts in comparison with nonexperts. Among these areas, the posterior superior parietal overactivity likely reflected spatial information processing in 2-dimensional space, which would be a characteristic of mental abacus operations.

*** Self-Control in Decision-Making Involves Modulation of the vmPFC Valuation System

    Todd A. Hare et al, /Science/ 2009

    4 main hypotheses

**** H1 vmPFC activity should correlate with S's goal values regardless of self-control

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     We tested the first prediction by estimating a general linear model (GLM) of blood oxygen level–dependent activity that included a parametric regressor for goal values at the time of evaluation. Activity in vmPFC was correlated with goal values for all participants regardless of the amount of self-control exercised (Fig. 2, A and B; fig. S1; and table S2). The areas of vmPFC identified largely overlap with regions that have been associated with valuation in other tasks that require no self-control (11–15) (Fig. 2C)
     #+END_QUOTE

**** H2 vmPFC activity should reflect health ratings for SC but NSC groups

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     To test the second prediction, we estimated a new GLMthat included parametric regressors for health and taste ratings. The beta values for both parametric regressors were extracted from the voxels in vmPFC that exhibited the strongest correlation with goal values for each participant. In the SC group, vmPFC activity was modulated by both health (t18 = 4.20,P< 0.001) and taste (t18= 3.31,P< 0.005) (Fig. 2D), whereas in the NSC group it was only modulated by taste (t17 = 7.28, P< 0.001). We tested this relationship further by estimating a linear regression of the impact of health ratings on each participant'sbehavioragainst a measure of the impact of health ratings on the participant's vmPFC activity (regression coefficient = 0.847,t35 =5.57,P< 0.001) (Fig. 2E)
     #+END_QUOTE

**** H3 DLPFC activation in self control trials > failed self-control trials

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     We tested the third prediction by comparing the neural responses during the decision period in three different types of trials: those in which self-control was not needed, those inwhich self-control was successfully deployed, and those in which participants failed to use self-control. We found greater left DLPFC activity [inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and Brodmann's area (BA) 9 (IGF/BA9)] in the SC group than in the NSC group during successful self-control trials (Fig. 3Aand table S3). However, both groups had greater activity in this region for successful self-control trials compared with that of failed self-control trials (SCgroupt14= 2.29, NSC groupt13 =2.62,P<0.05) (Fig.3B)
     #+END_QUOTE


**** H4 DLPFC and vmPFC should exhibit functional connectivity during self-control trials

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     We tested the fourth prediction by performing a linear regression of left DLPFC activity during self-control trials on the response of vmPFC to the presentation of liked-but-unhealthy food items (regression coefficient =–0.688,t17=–2.26;P< 0.05) (Fig. 3C). Self-control in this type of trial requires ramping down the weight given to taste in computing the goal value. A similar decrease in vmPFC activity was seen in gamblers who chose not to gamble in losing conditions (25).
     #+END_QUOTE

**** DLPFC may modulate vmPFC via IFG/BA46

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     This area was of particular interest because it is involved in working memory and goal maintenance (21, 22), it has anatomical connections to vmPFC (26), and pre-vious studies have shown that IFG/BA46 activity is correlated with goal values (11, 13)

     - Kable & Glimcher: vmPFC-strata is common valuation system regardless of self control

     this paper supports DLPFC as self control and not valuation.
       
     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     we show that this is not because an alternative value signal is encoded in DLPFC, which in our experiment would require a nonexistent correlation between activity in this area and the health ratings (fig. S5). Instead, the DLPFC influences self-control by modulating the value signal encoded in vmPFC.

      for the controls, simple and complex tasks induced almost the same activation areas. Activities were found in the bilateral inferior parietal lobule (LPi), left LPMC and right supplementary motor area (SMA) including the anterior cingulated cortex (ACC) in both SSA and CSA tasks. Moreover, significant activation was also found in the left inferior frontal gyrus (GFi) (BA 9, 45, 46) in CSA; and the region in LPi including HIPS extending anteriorly to the postcentral gyrus and laterally into the angular gyrus (AG). During CSA versus SSA task, both experts and controls showed activation areas primarily in the LPMC and PSPL (including the vicinity of precuneus). However, the occipital areas (BA 17, 18, 19) were significantly activated in experts while the GFi, ACC and cuneus showed increasing activation in controls. In auditory stimuli, the brain activation mapping closely corresponded to the similar activation in visual stimuli except that superior temporal cortices were significantly observed in CSA against SSA task contrast (Fig. 3). In this contrast, as Fig. 3 illustrated, there was no between-hemisphere difference in terms of the comparison of the peak activations obtained for both hemispheres in both stimuli.

*** Neural Bases of Selective Attention in Action Video Game Players

    D. Bavelier et al

**** background

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     It was first demonstrated that VGPs outperform NVGPs in selective attention by using the Useful Field of View (UFOV) paradigm initially developed by Ball and collaborators. This task requires subjects to distribute their attention widely over the screen and locate a peripheral target while ignoring irrelevant distractors (Feng, Spence, & Pratt, 2007; Green & Bavelier, 2003; Sekuler & Ball, 1986; Spence et al., 2009). Enhanced spatial selective attention in gamers has been shown more recently using different types of search tasks, such as the Swimmer task (West et al., 2008) or difficult visual search tasks (Hubert-Wallander, Green, & Bavelier, 2010; but see Castel, Pratt, & Drummond, 2005 for a different result)

     Under these high load conditions, VGPs and NVGPs similarly processed the attended streams, but VGPs more efficiently suppressed the unattended streams. Notably, this greater suppression was associated with faster reaction times. Greater distractor suppression may be a possible mechanism for more efficient executive and attentional control (Clapp et al., 2011 in older adults; Serences et al., 2004; Toepper et al., 2010)

In addition, increasing the search difficulty from the low to high load displays increased reaction times by about 70 ms in both VGPs and NVGPs indicating equal increase in difficulty from low to high load in the two populations compared.

     Seeding from parietal areas revealed no major differences in functional connectivity between VGPs and NVGPs.

A largely overlapping network of areas was observed to be functionally connected to the dorsal anterior cingulate and middle frontral gyrus in VGPs and NVGPs. These included, in addition to the two seed areas, the superior parietal cortex, the supra-marginal gyrus, the SMA, the pre-central gyrus, the insular cortex, and interestingly the anterior prefrontal cortex. Along with the superior parietal cortex, the insula and the pre-central gyrus, this anterior prefrontal area showed significantly greater connectivity with the anterior cingulate and the middle frontal gyrus in VGPs than in NVGPs

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     In summary, the resultsof this study found that theexpert group showed more activation of the visual association cortex of the left occipital lobeandACCthanthenovicegroup. Inaddition, thenovice group showed higher activation of the frontal area than the expert group. Activation of the posterior cingulate gyrus and cerebellar tonsil was seen in novices but not in experts. In particular, BA 6 is known to plan complex and coordinated movements, while BA 7 plays a role in the converging the sense of vision and proprioception. Moreover, according to Gerardin et al.[ 12] and Grafton et al.[ 14], BA 44 and BA 45 are involved in behavior recognition, and these areas were activated in the novice group during the process of recognizing arrow shooting. Thus, for the experts in this experiment, their advanced experience, long-term practice, motor coordination, emotional regulation, and task adaptation appeared to result in less frontal cortical activity when challenged with specific task demands.

     we can look at a few analogous situations. a beginning golfer going through swinging motions first (kinesthetic, procedural), fire drills (likewise), reading a book's table of contents (mostly declarative). rhythm however, is almost completely temporal. indeed, the clapping motion is dissociated from the actual motions of playing a non-percussive instrument. the system we're seeding here should thus be a system that specializes in temporal understanding.

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     activity was observed within the DLPFC in response to instructions to name the color but not read the word. 
     #+END_QUOTE

     supposedly this is because reading color is the less automatized action, so DLPFC holds the rule that the "less-expected" action should be taken. In this way the top-down control hypothesis is consistent. But their main takeaway

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     DLPFC provides top-down support of task-appropriate behaviors, whereas other components, such as the ACC, are likely to be involved in evaluative processes indicating when control needs to be more strongly engaged.
     #+END_QUOTE

     suggests they didn't actually restrict the interpretation to "less-expected" rule maintenance (and the expected rule takes little effort to maintain)

**** interpretation of dissociation of activity between DLPFC and ACC

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     This is consistent with a role in the implementation of control, by representing and actively maintaining the attentional demands of the task. In contrast, the ACC was selectively activated during the response period, more for incongruent than for congruent color-naming trials. This is consistent with a role in conflict monitoring

**** why the ACC is supposed to be distinct in this study

     their assumption:

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     Regions implementing control should be negatively correlated with the amount of conflict (i.e., more control, less conflict).
     #+END_QUOTE

     which is supported by:

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     This pattern was observed in the DLPFC, but the correlation between ACC activity and conflict was in a positive direction
     #+END_QUOTE

     the inference is fine, but should the assumption be? if it were prediction error, then the greater the conflict, the greater the region implementing control should activate (violation of expectation), such as in OFC in value judgment. taking time into account however, sure this makes sense. More control now, less conflict (error) later. But ACC activation occurs at the response phase, whereas DLFPC at the rule maintenace phase. So this assumption is ok but a bit lax.

     one subject could find rule encoding very difficult, expend a lot of energy on DLPFC activation, and suck at the stroop task afterwards, and experience conflict and increased ACC activation. Then we expect DLPFC up + ACC up in incongruence > congruence. A first vs. second half interaction analysis here would have been a good addition, as well as whether there was some kind of resource competition between the regions. The next interesting question is, assuming there is competition, how the delay period between first vs. second halves alters the response. That would be a cognitive load Stroop task. So, DLPFC up, something down, then ACC up...

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     ACC activity increases when top-down control is low, whether control is reduced from trial to trial or across a number of trials [fn:botvinicketal1999] [fn:carteretal2000]

     The effects of bizarre and interacting imagery on the acquistion and retrieval of 20 paired associates (PA) were examined using 30 young and 27 (out of 38) elderly who successfully learned the PAs to criterion. Interacting imagery facilitated acquisition, especially for the elderly, but did not benefit retrieval. There was no evidence that bizarre imageries were superior than logical ones in facilitating acquistion or retrieval. Furthermore, the elderly tended to resist using bizarre imagery, and both young and elderly subjects tended to use imagery that was more congruent with non-bizarre life experiences and events.

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     This study sought to evaluate the effects of the use of imagery in immediate recollection, at the end of one day and at the end of the week, according to the type of imagery employed: no images, normal image, unusual image and mixed image. For this test, 198 subjects were selected with an average age of 14.4 years, randomly assigned to one of four experimental groups: 1) group with no mental images, 2) group which used normal mental images, 3) group which used unusual images and 4) mixed group. A set of 16 sentences was shown to the groups, each of which contained three words written in block capitals. The subjects had to indicate the relationship between the three words (in the group without any image), or the intensity of the image provoked by each sentence (groups with images). We subsequently conducted an evaluation of the recollection, recognition, false recognition, access to the sentence, the items recalled by sentence and the number of sentences completely recollected. The subjects were also questioned about their experiences in the use of the images. It was ascertained that the experience in the use of the images influenced, at the end of the day and of the week, the recollection, recognition, the number of sentences completely recalled and the access to the sentence. After a week, the groups which were shown unusual or mixed images demonstrated better results in all the dependent variables (with the exception of the items recollected by sentence) than the groups which were shown normal mental images, or no images at all.

     midazolam, by acting on gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABA-A) receptors densely expressed in the hippocampus (Montpied et al., 1988), transiently but profoundly impairs explicit memory processes while leaving implicit memory intact (Thomas-Anterion et al., 1999).

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     Midazolam is a benzodiazepene that increases the binding of GABA to GABA-A receptors. Although GABA-A receptors are expressed throughout the brain, the GABA-A/benzodiazepene receptors are particularly densely expressed in the hippocampus, in far greater numbers than in striatum (Montpied et al., 1988). It has been shown that midazolam increases inhibitory currents in the CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus (Kobayashi et al., 2004; Kristiansen & Lambert, 1996; Poncer et al., 1996; Rovira & Ben-Ari, 1993) and inhibits hippocampal long-term potentiation (Evans & Viola-McCabe, 1996). In addition, various lines of evidence suggest that midazolam impairs hippocampal-dependent explicit memory processes, while sparing other forms of memory (Arndt, Passannante, & Hirshman, 2004; Hirshman, Fisher, Henthorn, Arndt, & Passannante, 2002; Hirshman et al., 2001; Park et al., 2004; Thomas-Anterion et al., 1999). Positron emission tomography studies have shown that midazolam decreases blood flow to the hippocampus and left prefrontal cortex, which interact with each other in explicit memory and reasoning processes, and that midazolam has no effect on striatal areas (Bagary et al., 2000; Reinsel et al., 2000).

**** /conjuctive/ and /elemental/ representations

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     The hippocampus supports explicit memorization of the conjunction of each stimulus pair (AB, BC, etc.) by automatically and rapidly binding together individual elements of the event (Atallah, Frank, & O'Reilly, 2004; Davachi & Wagner, 2002; Frank et al., 2003; O'Reilly & Rudy, 2001). In parallel, the basal ganglia–dopamine system learns an implicit elemental reinforcement value for each stimulus depending on how often its selection is associated with positive versus negative reinforcement (Frank, 2005; Frank, Rudy, et al., 2005; Frank et al., 2004). 
     #+END_QUOTE

***** learning relative valuations and performing comparitive judgments without logic and declarative memory

      #+BEGIN_QUOTE
      participants may choose B over D simply because B has a higher dopamine reinforcement value; they do not have to explicitly perform any logical reasoning. This mechanism explains why participants can respond transitively even when they are prevented from becoming explicitly aware of logical structure (Frank, Rudy, et al., 2005; Greene, Spellman, Dusek, Eichenbaum, & Levy, 2001) and is consistent with the effects of dopaminergic manipulation on learning in a TI task (Frank et al., 2004).

Stimulus C is correct in 70% of CD trials, and E is correct in 60% of EF trials. Over the course of training, participants learn to choose stimuli A, C, and E more often than B, D, or F. 
     #+END_QUOTE

     this is in other words a multi-armed bandit task with the same uniform distribution, but different mean values, on each arm, presented iteratively in pairs. It is interesting that they suggest that subjects choose the "correct" arms ~more often~ instead of deterministically selecting the higher-valued arm.

***** A superbly written section on the reasoning for the ANOVA analysis

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     Our hypothesis that the hippocampus is important for rapidly memorizing stimulus conjunctions leads to additional predictions for learning patterns during the training phases of both tasks. In the TI task, the anchor pairs AB and DE are the easiest to learn because stimulus A is always correct and stimulus E is always incorrect. The middle pairs (BC and CD) are more difficult and may benefit from explicit memorization of stimulus conjunctions to prevent interference. We hypothesized that midazolam should impair memorization of stimulus conjunctions and would be associated with worse performance on the middle pairs than in the saline condition. In contrast, the tendency for participants to rely on reinforcement learning systems under midazolam was expected to lead to better performance on the anchor pairs than in the saline condition. We further hypothesized that these effects would be apparent very early in training, given the known role of the hippocampus in automatically and rapidly encoding stimulus conjunctions in very few trials (O'Reilly & Rudy, 2001). After multiple training trials, the differential reinforcement values learned for stimulus items A through E should be sufficient for good performance on all pairs.
     #+END_QUOTE

      #+BEGIN_QUOTE
      results support the hypothesis that midazolam administration leads to increased reliance on reinforcement learning about individual stimuli (as evidenced by better anchor-pair performance than in the saline condition), together with reduced ability to rapidly bind together stimulus elements into conjunctive pairs (as evidenced by impaired middle-pair performance).

**** =Ullman's differential hypothesis= is not well-supported

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     A recent theory claims that the processing of L2 acquired late in life depends upon different cognitive mechanisms and cerebral structures from L1 [fn:ullman2001]. Following this view, grammatical knowledge for L2 is declarative rather than implicit, as is the case for L1 grammar. By contrast, lexical knowledge is represented in the declarative memory system for both L1 and L2. Because implicit and declarative knowledge are mediated by distinct neural systems (a left frontal-basal ganglia circuit for implicit knowledge and left temporal language areas for declarative knowledge), Ullman's differential hypothesis claims that L2 acquisition in adulthood could not depend on the same brain mechanisms that are used to process the native language [fn:ullman2001].

One might argue this is a one-time cost, which is true, but the real utility of a mnemonic system should be a highly versatile set of tools that one can employ nearly on-the-fly, as needed. Levin also addresses this somewhat, in the Grade B section, i.e., how the burden is placed too heavily on students (to use their own creativity, varying levels of effectiveness from learning curves etc.), but that's part of the whole issue.

     positive-affect index increases monotonically for all groups, significant only for loser group. Also, max. affect for losers (on $5) is less than min. affect for winners (on $3).

     29 (after 2 exclusions) people, probably not pedestrians but lab participants, completed 4 rounds of 2-alternative forced choices by this matrix of combinations:

     |      8 |       5 | loadHI.payHI |
     
All choices are lose trials, i.e., if payoff is $5, you were at the end shown the other choice would have been >$5; probably $7. Also note they had a $5 participation fee.

digits are to be memorized during choice, acts as cognitive load manipulation. Prediction is high load saps cognitive resources so relative comparision (against higher value alternative) is harder, thus happiness across high vs. low in high-load conditions should be similar, but in low load it should be higher for high payoff.

Looks like affect was measured after every choice, thus there are =4 * 29 = 116= data points, which they do repeated measures ANOVA on. Figure 2 is fairly clear. The significances are all 0.05 range, the interaction of =load*amount= is 0.08.

**** juggling training

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     Subjects in the juggler group were given 3 months to learn a classic three-ball cascade juggling routine. A second brain scan was performed when they had become skilled performers (that is, when they could sustain juggling for at least 60 seconds). A third scan was carried out 3 months later; during the intervening period, none of the jugglers practised or attempted to extend their skills -- for example, by learning a four-ball or a reverse cascade. In fact, most subjects were no longer fluent in three-ball cascade juggling by the time of the third scan.

**** changes in hMT/V5

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     In the longitudinal analysis, the juggler group demonstrated a significant (44 d.f., P<0.05) transient bilateral expansion in grey matter in the mid-temporal area (hMT/V5) and in the left posterior intraparietal sulcus between the first and the second scans. This expansion decreased in the third scan (Fig. 1). We found a close relationship in these regions between the transient structural grey-matter changes and the juggling performance. These findings were specific to the training stimulus, as the nonjugglers showed no change in grey matter over the same period.

*** inducing cognitive biases in rats via manipulation of affect

    titled ~Cognitive bias and affective state~, Harding et al /Nature/ 2004; it followed the Draganski article

    Rats are separated into "predictable" and "unpredictable" housing, the unpredictable housing basically induces a state in the rats analogous to depressive or anxious states in humans.

    #+BEGIN_QUOTE
    Overall, rats in unpredictable housing were slower to respond and tended to show fewer responses to ambiguous tones close to the positive tone and to this tone itself.
    #+END_QUOTE

    i.e., rats were trained to respond to 2 tones, 1 is rewarding, the other is punishing.

    After housing, rats are presented with tones ambiguous between the 2, and authors look at the switching point. In short, anxious rats shift the criterion location away from the positive.

The next step is to relate the keyword pot to the meaning, /duck/. This could be accomplished by picturing a duck inside a pot. In this way, a direct retrieval path is formed that links the foreign word pato with its English meaning, /duck/.

***** TODO reconstruct graph of table 1

      SD in taxonomy production is lower in the beginning. Close to ceiling effect; in other words, it works very well. Largest SD in free study groups reflects differences in efficacies of individual strategies.

      Over time though, the SD in the mnemonic group becomes the highest. This reflects individual differences in memory decay. The decay in the free study group is surprisingly slow in taxonomy reproduction. (for definitions, it is unsurprising)

***** on the jump in recall 

      #+BEGIN_QUOTE
      An explanation for this seemingly unusual result is that subjects could have capitalized on the second reading of the passage, which immediately followed the two initial tests, to consolidate (restudy) information that they were initially unable to remember. That is, the second reading of the passage, with directions to focus on distinguishing characteristics, may not just have helped subjects learn those characteristics but also may have provided both a review of the taxonomic information and a chance for subjects to check the accuracy of their performance on the first two tests. Note as well, that in Table 1 no similar performance improvements occurred between Times 2 and 3, during which time (in addition to the between test interval being longer) no rereading opportunity was provided.
      #+END_QUOTE

***** differences in process of recall failure

      #+BEGIN_QUOTE
      In the process of scoring the taxonomy-production task, it became apparent that subjects in the mnemonic condition were not guessing as often, but rather preferred to omit a term when they were not certain of where it should be placed in the taxonomy. In contrast, subjects in the two other conditions produced many incorrect placements.
      #+END_QUOTE

***** difference in retrieval pathway

      #+BEGIN_QUOTE
      An important methodological point worth mentioning is that because of the consistent "All (lower terms) are (higher terms)" wording of items in the taxonomy-use task, the present mnemonic subjects may have had a unique advantage over subjects in the other two experimental conditions. Mnemonic subjects could readily determine an answer simply by "seeing" whether the recoded term was in the picture grouping or not.
      #+END_QUOTE

***** differences in mnemonic strategy guided attention

      both taxonomic and control subjects noticed common suffixes, but:

      #+BEGIN_QUOTE
      Mnemonic subjects, on the other hand, were less likely to notice the suffixes because their keywords were derived from the word prefixes (e.g., angel, pan, arrow). It is likely that the taxonomy-production scores of mnemonic subjects would have been even higher if this uniformity-of-suffix information had been brought to their attention.

However: yes, I can remember angiosperm is above the dino-like-word in the hierarchy, but i cannot remember the dino-like-word on first reading. FYI, it's "dicotyledon"). thus it promotes an entertaining aspect to it. *does this impact the process of deep, deliberative learning?*

      arguably though, if the material is dry, then recall should take priority, as consolidation will first occur subconsciously. build connections first, and the pathways are accessed automatically later on. *question is what's the difference of depth between these 2 learning strategies?*
      
**** takeaways

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     the mnemonic strategy seemed to produce a more intact knowledge structure against which subjects could check the accuracy of their recall.
     #+END_QUOTE
      
     "reproduce", not "produce": correct structure is a consequence of correct recall of association. in other words, the recall does not depend on *comprehension* of the structure.

      no significant performance difference between the optional verbal/keyword generated and the imagery/keyword generated conditions, and definition recall in both conditions was superior to performance in the no-strategy control condition.

In contrast, the imagery/keyword generated strategy was effective regardless of verbal fluency or spatial ability. In addition, the overall facilitating effects of the keyword instructions did not depend on whether the definition referent was concrete or abstract. (The latter result was recently replicated with children by Pressley, Levin, & Miller, in press a.)

Pressley, Levin, Nakamura, Hope, Bispo, and Toye (1980) anticipated that the same kind of interaction observed by Rohwer et al. (1977) might be obtained in keyword-method research. These authors first identified samples of good and poor Latin vocabulary learners on the basis of a pretest. Then, the subjects were randomly assigned to imagery/keyword provided and no-strategy control conditions, and were asked to learn a second (longer) list of Latin words. Contrary to the predicted pattern of results, use of the keyword method produced comparably positive effects for both good and poor vocabulary learners.

     facilitation in young students is less interesting as their memory traces should -- over several years -- be stronger than those of adults undergoing the same duration of study of the same topic, presumably all starting from a rudimentary level. for non-rudimentary levels, well, then the starting age is presumably much older and memory much more calcified.

**** Atkinson's Questions

     
***** Is it better for the experimenter to provide keywords with the vocabulary items or for subjects to generate their own keywords?

      #+BEGIN_QUOTE
      evidence is mixed. In some experiments, no significant difference was found between experimenter-provided and subject-generated keyword conditions (Fuentes,
1976; Pressley, Levin, Nakamura, Hope, Bispo, & Toye, 1980;Delaney & Starr, Note 2; McGivern, Note 3). In other studies, experimenter-provided keywords have sometimes proven superior to those generated by the subject (Hall, Wilson, & Patterson, 1981; Pressley, Levin, & Miller, Note 10) and sometimes worse (Delaney & Starr, Note 2; McGivern, Note 3).5 One possible explanation of these differences in results is that provided/generated differences are associated only with certain subject populations and/or stimulus characteristics. The McGivern (Note 3) results discussed earlier were consistent with this interpretation. In that study, children with greater vocabulary knowledge benefited more from generating their own keywords than from experimenter-provided keywords, whereas those with less vocabulary knowledge experienced comparable benefits from generated and provided keywords.
      #+END_QUOTE

****** TODO author's question, look for followup

       #+BEGIN_QUOTE
       A particularly relevant stimulus variable that begs examination is the extent to which the vocabulary materials lend themselves to rapid and salient keyword derivations. As vocabulary/keyword connections become more difficult to discover, it is probable that experimenter-provided keywords would prove more effective (Levin, 1981)
       #+END_QUOTE

***** Is it better for the experimenter to provide the keyword/definition links or for subjects to generate their own?

      #+BEGIN_QUOTE
      whenever differences have been found, both with children and with adults, the advantage has been in favor of supplying the imagery link. (For additional data on this question, see Shriberg, Levin, McCormick, & Pressley, in press.)
      #+END_QUOTE

****** cost of mnemonic construction

       this is a constantly important point that, based on casual observation of commercial products even today, appears to remain unsolved or majorly overlooked

       #+BEGIN_QUOTE
       On the one hand, then, it would appear that the cost of constructing interactive illustrations for every stimulus/response pair outweighs the slight benefit produced by such illustrations (relative to subject-generated images) among older children and adults. On the other hand, and as Levin (1981) has recently argued, such costs may have to be incurred if the materials to be linked are complex and do not lend themselves to readily generated images, or are to be used with populations in which execution of all of the components of the keyword strategy is difficult
       #+END_QUOTE
       
***** Does use of the keyword method affect (specifically, reduce) the speed with which subjects can retrieve definitions?

      #+BEGIN_QUOTE
      Based on one study, Atkinson concluded that speed of retrieval of an item was not negatively affected by use of the keyword method, especially if the items to be retrieved were well learned. Although no follow-up research has been conducted on this problem within the keyword paradigm specifically, recent basic research on imagery mnemonics is consistent with Atkinson's conclusion (see Corbett, 1977).
      #+END_QUOTE

****** TODO find followup

       Under certain conditions I expect the exact opposite: that interference from the mnemonic device makes it dominatingly the retrieval path of least resistance. Hence, the desired association of A to B is not strengthened, but A to M (M for mnemonic) and M to B are highly strengthened, and being a 2-step retrieval process, the latency should be persistent and highly resistant to decay. This has 2 effects. Firstly, from a research standpoint, the memory as measured by standardized tests would be "strong" and also deemed reasonably fast, especially when measured in isolation (i.e., not when, say, reading a passage with many other interdependent facts). But secondly, it will always be slower.

       Of course this depends on the semblance of the cue "M" to the target "B". If this were an abstract cue then the 2-step "slowdown" should be easily measurable. A memory researcher provides this viewpoint as of 2013-07:

       #+BEGIN_QUOTE
       These is not that much work on this kind of strategy interestingly. No one really seems to get at the mechanism of how the assistive device (M - be it chunking, etc) disappears. There is a lot of computational work on strategy, but not this kind per se and not thinking about how to get rid of the linking device.
       #+END_QUOTE
       
***** Are there differences in the effectiveness of imagery and sentence versions of the keyword method?

      #+BEGIN_QUOTE
      Atkinson concluded that the imagery version was slightly superior to the sentence version ... [and] in light of the data collected since 1975, Atkinson's original conclusion seems to have been supported.
      #+END_QUOTE
      
***** TODO further questions by the authors

      each demands a separate followup.

****** TODO For multisyllable vocabulary words, is it better to provide one-syllable or multisyllable keywords? If the former, which syllable should be keyworded?

****** TODO Does it make a difference whether the keyworded syllable corresponds to the accented syllable of the vocabulary word?

****** TODO How similar must keywords and vocabulary words be in order for the method to be successful?

****** TODO Can the method work effectively if the keywords themselves are abstract? 

**** Vocabulary Pronunciation

     (phonological interference)

     Fuentes 1976 study using Spanish vocabulary

     Due to English keywords serving as cues to Spanish words, ~[use] of the keyword method was expected to result in "anglicized" pronunciations of the Spanish words. However, this apparently did not occur, or at least it did not occur systematically enoug hfor it to be detected on a specially constructed pronunciation rating scale.~ In retrospect, this is not surprising; the cue should map to the perception of the Spanish word, where the perception includes the actual phonological memory trace, such as what the student remembers as the teacher's pronunciation. Interference is expected, but when the student reproduces the word, they aren't drawing from a purely English pot of phonology. If the student does reproduce anglicized versions, I predict they would do so even without keyword-cued recall (which is a separate dynamic in second language acquisition).
     
**** Vocabulary Spelling

     Pressley, Levin, Nakamura, Hope, Bispo, and Toye (1980) study on recall of Latin words

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     on vocabulary items for which keywords were spelled differently than the corresponding Latin word syllable (e.g., trunk for truncus), the keyword-provided condition resulted in the poorest spelling performance.
     #+END_QUOTE

     Pressley et. al believe that those results were confounded because ~subjects had no foreknowledge that spelling accuracy was important and later would be assessed~. But unlike the pronunciation route above, I find orthographic interference here to be much more plausible. At the same time, orthographic reproduction (writing) is second to phonological reproduction (speaking) in language acquisition.

*** Music training and rate of presentation as mediators of text and song recall

    Kilgour et. al 2000

**** past research on increased recall of text when paired with melody

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     under certain circumstances, text paired with melody (in the form of songs) is better remembered than spoken text alone (e.g., Boker, 1976; Jellison, 1976; Wallace, 1994; Yalch, 1991). It has been suggested that this effect is due to the integration of melody and text in memory (Morrongiello & Roes, 1990; Serafine, Crowder, & Repp, 1984; Serafine, Davidson, Crowder, & Repp, 1986). This integration is thought to provide a larger pool of components that can be triggered with appropriate memory cues, thereby increasing the likelihood of better recall for the material.
     #+END_QUOTE

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     Wallace (1994) ... found that pairing melody and text did improve subjects' recall performance (Experiment 1), but only if the melody was sufficiently or easily learned (Experiments 3 and 4). Providing strong rhythmic intonation and beat in spoken presentation of the text (as opposed to melodic contour) did not facilitate recall performance (Experiment 2). Wallace concluded that, in order to learn and recall text associated with melody, one needs to learn enough of the melodic form to (1) provide information about line and syllable length, (2) chunk text together appropriately, and (3) extract rhythmical information.
     #+END_QUOTE
     
     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     past research showing that individuals who have had formal music training perceive musical structure that is unnoticed by those with no music training (Beal, 1985; Morrongiello, 1992) and employ superior encoding strategies with respect to musical material (e.g., Huntsinger & Jose, 1991; Mikumo, 1992).
     #+END_QUOTE

     is this because of neural encoding efficiency driven by learning (of music). i.e., is "noticing the musical structure" a result of freeing of cognitive resources due to training (thus greater processing efficiency of the complex stimuli), or because novel pattern recognition structures have developed? These are not mutually exclusive, but the critical features are different: if this were the former (trained efficiency), then the effect should be modulated by cognitive load, such that comparing musically-trained individuals under load to novices with a brief training period without load should yield possibly similar results of pattern detection; if the latter, then the effect should resemble e.g. inabilities to discern subtle differences in accent for late L2 learners vs early L2 learners.

**** experiment 1 methods

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     Half of the participants had very little or no music training (mean, 0.8 years; SD = 1.1; range, 0-2 years of training) ... remaining participants were musically trained (at least Royal Conservatory Grade VIII level; I mean, 10.8 years; SD = 2.7).

     presented 4 times, asked to recall as much as possible after presentation 1, 2, and 4.

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     After the fourth presentation and subsequent recall, the participants completed a number search task during a 15-min retention interval. This task was chosen for the retention interval because, being of a nonverbal nature, it would not directly interfere with memory for the verses but would prevent rehearsal. At the end of this interval, the participants gave one final verbatim recall. 
     #+END_QUOTE

**** results

     unsurprisingly, melody groups had better overall recall

***** TODO figure 1. Recall performance improved steadily over trials

      if there isn't an analysis of trial-to-trial marginal benefit, we should reconstruct it

      authors did look for a quadratic fit (didn't find it) in a later section. but I don't recall the marginal benefit discussed. The ANOVA may have been enough and I glossed over it. The interesting question is the how musical background moderates the curve of acquisition over time (i.e. number of presentations in this study). This could hint at what mechanisms are being used, since authors are pointing in a "sensitivity" direction: similarly shaped curves suggest optimization of similar regions; differently shaped curves suggest recruitment of other regions. It's not that simple, but something to look out for later on.

***** musically-trained participants had superior recall even without melody

      #+BEGIN_QUOTE
      recall performance of participants in the three conditions did not differ significantly on the first recall trial, but began to diverge on Trial 2. By Trial 3, the recall performance of the participants in both of the conditions involving melody was superior to that of the participants in the spoken condition. 
      #+END_QUOTE

      #+BEGIN_QUOTE
      Under all three conditions, however, trained musicians outperformed those without music training [F(1,72) = 15.87, p < .001; see Figure 1].
      #+END_QUOTE

***** whether the recall is attributable to melody

      #+BEGIN_QUOTE
      Yalch (1991) found that the music must be compatible with the lyrics phonetically to be an effective mnemonic-that is, the number of notes in the melody should reasonably match the number of syllables in the lyrics. In addition, Wallace argued that if the music is not relatively simple and easily learned, it not only will be useless as a memory aid, but will detract attention from the text and hinder recall.
      #+END_QUOTE

      #+BEGIN_QUOTE
      (contrary to prediction) even subjects with music training required several exposures to the melody before it was able to serve as a useful mnemonic. Thus, having an opportunity to listen to the full piano accompaniment once before hearing the text sung did not substantially improve performance over simply hearing the text sung

      #+BEGIN_QUOTE
      Although Experiment 2 utilized a different song than Experiment 1, superior recall performance of musically trained participants was replicated ... This suggests that the well-documented memory advantage for sung over spoken lyrics (e.g., Boker, 1976; Jellison, 1976; Wallace, 1994; Yalch, 1991) may be an artifact of the (typically) slower presentation rates of sung materials.

For example, an individual may have a Full Scale IQ of 110 that is composed ofa Verbal IQ of 121 and a Performance IQ of 97. This pattern of scores reflects the individual's superior verbal ability, which is accompanied by an average nonverbal ability. For adults 20 years of age and older, a nine-point difference between Verbal and Performance IQ signifies statistical significance.

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     we trained three groups of white rats to learn a black-white discrimination habit. One group was given food for the correct response. The second group was rewarded in the same way and shocked for the wrong response. These two control groups showed the usual differences, the first group acquiring the habit much more slowly than the group that was shocked for the wrong response. The critical ratio for the difference between the means of the errors for the first 100 trials was 14.8.

     variation on the California experiment setup, using buttons instead of a stylus; shock was a single shock, instead
     of a succession of shocks. Intuition says aside of the shock difference, the stylus vs. button is inconsequential.

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     The contact plates of one hole in each of the thirty pairs was connected with an electric circuit so that when the stylus was introduced it rang a buzzer or, in the case of some groups, gave an electric shock plus the ringing of the buzzer. . . . The wiring was so arranged that when the stylus made contact with the plate at the back of the hole it . . . caused an electric shock to pass through the subject by way of the stylus in his one hand and the electrode in his other" ([fn:tolmanetal1932], pp. 601-603). The shock came from the secondary of an induction coil, and each "subject was asked to regulate the inductorium to give the maximum amount of electric current which he felt he could stand. An attempt to offset the factor of adaptation was made by increasing the strength after each trial" ([fn:tolmanetal1932], p. 605).
     #+END_QUOTE

     interesting whether the buzzer sound is emotionally pleasant or not, even if it doesn't have a physical sensation component

**** Critical ratio analysis

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     Critical Ratio = difference between means divided by the probable error of the difference. A positive value indicates that the mean for the first condition is higher than that for the second, or that the first condition is less effective; a negative value indicates the opposite.
     #+END_QUOTE

     The general conclusion is that no interesting differences were found. Max critical ratio is 3.8, min is -2.2. This
     is out of 20 trials (of executing a 30-item button sequence), and 26 subjects per group, where the total errors for
     20 trials spans 116.1 to 145.2. So we're looking at a ~2% difference between groups. A time course would have been
     interesting, but the deviation is so small that this experiment or manipulation is likely not sensitive enough.
     
     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     this problem is bound to yield more significant results with animals than with human adults as subjects since the latter are so completely motivated in the usual laboratory situation that the addition of shock cannot produce an accelerating effect upon learning
     #+END_QUOTE

***** comment on comparison between shocks for right vs wrong

      #+BEGIN_QUOTE
      Since the critical ratios in all these cases are rather small -- none above 2 -- our conclusion must be that the addition of shock in these cases produces only insignificant differences. For the four conditions named here the critical ratios of the differences between the means of the errors for the first twenty trials are 0.2, 1.2, 1.3, and 1.9 respectively
      #+END_QUOTE

      again, my mental image of the "bell", which is a "buzzer" is a very displeasing reaction

***** what about the effect observed for rats?

      #+BEGIN_QUOTE
      Must we therefore assume different laws for human and animal learning?
      
      The experimental group of rats was also rewarded with food but shocked for the right response.
      ...
      In the experiment with human subjects the group shocked for the right response did not show any such difference. 
      #+END_QUOTE

      Muenzinger makes a distinction on motivation:

      #+BEGIN_QUOTE
      The behavior of a human subject is imbedded in a tension produced by 'laboratory instructions-perception of goal,'
      that is, the consent to follow instructions takes the place of the hunger drive in the rat and in place of food as
      the goal we have the mere achievement of reaching the goal. We consider it superfluous to use food, say in the
      form of candy, which would not add to the tension which is probably near its maximum strength in the usual
      laboratory situation. For the same reason we need not expect any increase in tension if we use punishment in the
      form of electric shock. In other words, we suspect that human subjects in a laboratory situation are so well
      motivated already that the addition of electric shock has no effect upon their learning efficiency.
      #+END_QUOTE

      But there's more to it than that. One must also discuss dual-processes, i.e., for the human, the shock carries
      beyond a visceral component, a cognitive component ("you are wrong" or "you are right").

      One interesting thing about the motivation-based interpretation above is how it relates to the historical research
      climate. The interpretation is perfectly valid, but how much of it was the "easy" interpretation due to the tint
      of the spectacles popular at the time?
      
***** shock as a disrupter

      #+BEGIN_QUOTE
      The California experimenters indorse the report of other investigators that electric shock has a 'disrupting
      effect,' that it tends 'to hinder learning wherever it is introduced' ([fn:tolmanetal1932], p. 612).
      #+END_QUOTE

      ... probably by means of unpleasant distraction, like reading next to a periodically crying baby

      under this interpretation, learning disruption due to unwanted distraction is not the same as disruption due to
      punishment

    Both the pseudohomophone effect and the physical versus name match difference came through strongly in our data, but neither of these effects was predictive of reading comprehension. In this respect, our data do not support the suggestion of Hunt et al. [fn:huntetal1973] that the physical/name match difference will be a powerful predictor of speed of access to verbal memory, and as such a predictor of reading skill. Our results are more consistent with the view that all these tasks have some common component, possibly simply information processing speed, a component that overlaps to some extent with reading comprehension, but is not the principal determinant.

These ranged from deciding whether two letters were or were not physically identical, (e.g., AA vs Aa), whether they had the same name (e.g., Aa vs Ab), whether words had the same meaning (e.g., /large-great/ vs /large-hot/), and whether two words had a similar sound (e.g., /read-reed/ vs /read-raid/).

        identity; in this condition, the letters in each pair were both either uppercase or lowercase, hence examples of
        "yes" items might be AA or bb, while pairs like ab or AB should provoke a "no" response. A second condition
        involved a name match. In this condition, all letter pairs comprised a mixture of upper and lowercase. Examples
        of "yes" responses here would be Aa and Bb, while negative items might be Ab Ba [fn:posneretal1967].

his car/ (sensible) followed by the cue, for example, "objects," to which the subject should respond /idea/ and /car/.

     - ~Comprehension appears to be significantly correlated with working memory span, hence replicating D&C~

      #+END_QUOTE

      this appears to be just a digit span with a subitizing component. The usage of dots above 5 or 6 will then
      start taxing a perceptual process; if there's a lapse in attention, then at say 9 dots, there may be some
      frontal interference, but on the surface this is a very simple task. Authors do note that this was devised
      ~to study the development of working memory in children.~ In this study, dots go from 2 to 9.

      indeed, authors later conclude ~we should consider the further possibility that our counting span is simply not a good measure of general working memory capacity.~

**** experiment: 2-arm bandit task

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     On each trial, subjects are presented with two fractal stimuli and asked to select one (Fig. 1A), with the objective of accumulating as much money as possible. After making a choice, subjects receive either a monetary gain or a monetary loss. However, one choice is "correct" in that choosing that stimulus leads to a greater probability of winning money and hence to an accumulating monetary gain, whereas the other choice is "incorrect" in that choosing that stimulus leads to a greater probability of losing money and hence to an accumulating monetary loss. After a time, the contingencies reverse so that what was the correct choice becomes the incorrect choice and vice versa. To choose optimally, subjects need to work out which stimulus is correct and continue to choose that stimulus until they determine that the contingencies have reversed, in which case they should switch their choice of stimulus.

     One stimulus is designated the correct stimulus, in that choosing that stimulus leads to a monetary reward on 70%

     we separated the original fMRI data into global signals with a spatial scale bigger than 8 mm and local signals with a spatial scale smaller than 8 mm
     #+END_QUOTE


     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     1. The activity in each voxel was scaled such that the variance of the BOLD activity over all trials in a session was equalized across all voxels.
     2. The fMRI data were spatially smoothed by using a Gaussian kernel with a full width at half maximum of 8 mm, to capture global changes in signal.
     3. fMRI data containing only locally distributed spatial signals were then extracted by subtracting the smoothed
        fMRI data (obtained in =2=), from the non-spatially smoothed fMRI data (obtained in =1=)
        
     This procedure adopts the assumption that BOLD activity is a function of the underlying neuronal activity that is identical across neighboring voxels, except for a scaling constant. Furthermore, =1= estimates and eliminates the scaling differences across voxels, but errors in the estimation of this scaling could lead to an incomplete dissociation between local and global signals. The procedure also assumes that if local encodings exist, they will have the same scaling characteristics across all brain regions.

     built regional classifiers using a multivariate approach that takes into account interactions between multiple
     regions of interest when decoding decisions (see Fig. 1B). This approach optimally combines both local and global
     signals from each region of interest. To determine which subset of regions to include in our classifier, we
     performed a hierarchical analysis whereby we started with the most accurate individual region and then iteratively
     built multiregion classifiers by adding one region at a time. At each step in this iterative process, we added the

     #+END_QUOTE

**** classifier accuracy

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     When combining both local and global signals and evaluating decoding accuracy for each region alone, we find that each region can decode better than chance whether a subject is going to switch or not (Fig. 3B), with the highest accuracies being obtained by ACC (64%), anterior insula (62%), and DLPFC (60%).

     The results of this study demonstrate that it is possible to decode, with a high degree of accuracy, reward-related decisions or the consequence of those decisions (in terms of initiating a change in response choice) in human subjects on the basis of neural activity measured with fMRI before the specific physical action involved is either planned or executed

     on temporal relation between neural response vs. decision implementation

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     the decision to switch or maintain current response set may be initiated as soon as the information needed to compute the decision is available, rather than being implemented only when required on the subsequent trial.
     #+END_QUOTE

     this is interesting, because in "classical" event related analysis, there is an assumption that the decision point
     is adequately detectable by a given onset plus an HRF time lag. while it is known that this is a weak assumption,
     and indeed, HRFs vary by region and process, it is still assumed that by enough examples, an effect should be
     detectable. not that the finding here invalidates current methodology, but it would even be interesting to
     challenge the notion that the decision point actually /doesn't happen at the decision point/, but at some possibly
     fixed (again, with the "enough examples" assumption) lag after some kind of information input.

     suppose we have a task that involves 2 steps: a cue indicating if the question will be "A or B" or "1 or 2", then
     the actual choice. we'd expect the actual choice to be modeled at the 2nd epoch, but the choice clearly starts
     before that. since the classification here is above chance but weak (67%), there may well be some non-uniform lag
     and continuous signal integration that would take a larger and varying time window to capture.

**** measurements

***** efficiency of phonological coding, measured by articulating speed (AS)

     - English AS = 116 (syllables in 40 words) x 2.0 / time for articulating 40 words (sec.)
     - Japanese AS = 197 (moras in 40 words) x 2.0 / time for articulating 40 words (sec.)

***** efficiency of lexical access, measured by Stroop interference

**** interpretations

     the most surprising part of the paper is the connection made between how ~there was no significant correlation
     between the efficiency of lexical access measured as English Stroop interference and reading comprehension~ and the
     interpretation that ~there is no role of lexical access in reading comprehension~. This is /not/ their final
     interpretation, but is a strange addition to the discussion.

     More suitably interpreting the dominance of the phonological measures in predicting comprehension,

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     efficiency of phonological coding means not only better processing of written information but also sparing processing resources in the working memory for higher-level processing like comprehension [fn:nicholson1999] [fn:stanovich2000].
     #+END_QUOTE

[fn:nicholson1999] Nicholson, T. (1999). Reading comprehension processes.

     And more suitably on the lack of Stroop interference,

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     One interpretation is that Stoop tasks are to measure the automaticity of lexical access, not the efficacy
     #+END_QUOTE

     but then,

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     Another is that the color words used as stimuli in the tasks were too easy and more difficult stimuli would have measured the efficiency more properly. Thus, the relationship between the efficiency of lexical access and reading comprehension should be re-examined by adopting revised Stroop tasks with more difficult stimuli, e.g., color-associated words such as blood, ocean and forest, or by other measures of lexical access.
     #+END_QUOTE

     The proposal is weak, because Stroop measures a composite of the access time of orthographic recognition, lexical
     access, and in this this design, phonological production. /Each/ of these steps involve an automaticity
     assumption. Increasing the difficulty of the words impacts the orthographical and lexical access components, but
     still will not cleanly test the question of whether this is an automaticity or efficacy task. As a thought
     experiment, suppose a stroop effect is found for "incongruent" cases such as "ocean" printed in red, "blood"
     printed in green, "sky" printed in yellow. The word-color association here is secondary (by LTM retrieval of the
     object prototype, then LTM coactivation of a color property of the prototype, /then/ possibly a concept-level
     interference; remember again the Stroop color task assumes a one-step retrieval between color word and color
     concept!). If the assumption is that /lexical efficacy/ is fast enough for some students so it causes concept-level
     interference before speech production of a /color word/, that would imply the incongruent color's access time was
     somehow interfered by a 2-step-removed LTM access process. Possible, but unlikely to be cleanly detected by such a
     modified Stroop task.

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     results are congruous to those for the first research question and confirm the favorable effect of efficient phonological coding and little effect of efficient lexical access on reading comprehension for the participants.
     #+END_QUOTE

     This is a surprising conclusion, but also plausible in this context. There are potential concerns about whether the
     measures are appropriate: English AS is about 1/3 of Japanese. Is this slow for ESL? Mean of the =ACE= score is
     around 50%. Is this a low score? Do we observe stable Stroop effects for both Japanese and English at this possibly
     low level of fluency? Does this mean =ACE= in particular is not sensitive to Stroop-implicated lexical access?

     According to Athanassios et al 2007, Stroop loads highly on word form encoding efficiency. It's quite possible the
     results here reflect that the overhead induced by L2 access is not actually reflective of less efficiency in
     lexical acecss (i.e., we're seeing a floor effect on lexical access speed for both languages), which supports the
     interpretation by the authors that the bottleneck is more of a phonological (or other) nature.

     Note we aren't talking generally about how important phonological access is in comprehension; results here
     underline its importance, but it doesn't encompass e.g. a case where /every subject scores 20 on the ACE
     test/. That is much more interesting.

*** Reading Ability Is Negatively Related to Stroop Interference

    Athanassios Protopapas & Anastasia Archonti & Christos Skaloumbakas 2007

**** Stroop interference

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     can be taken as a measure of reading automaticity (Logan, 1997). Therefore, intuitively, reading skill should be
     expected to be positively correlated with Stroop interference, with better readers exhibiting stronger
     interference. Even though expression of such a general expectation is found in the literature (Samuels, 1999),
     certain research findings also exist that are difficult to reconcile with it (e.g., Everatt, Warner, & Miles, 1997)
     #+END_QUOTE


     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     text-level automaticity has also been proposed (Logan, 1997; Samuels & Flor, 1997). This means that little eVort or
     attention is required to derive word meanings from the written letter strings. Thus, in skilled readers, sufficient
     cognitive resources are thought to be available for computation of the meaning of the text (Adams, 1990; LaBerge &
     Samuels, 1974; Samuels, 1999).
     #+END_QUOTE

**** Automaticity

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     Automaticity does entail flawless and rapid processing of text, that is, increased speed and accuracy of reading,
     but, consistent with Logan's (1997) multi-component analysis, it is probably not a unitary construct in its
     application to reading development. Stanovich (1990) has separated the components of obligatoriness, speed, and
     resource limitations, arguing that even though skilled reading, being an automatic process, is seen as obligatory,
     fast, and resource-free at the same time, reading practice past the point of accurate decoding does not necessarily
     achieve these goals simultaneously. In particular, obligatoriness may develop quickly while speed may still lag
     behind.
     #+END_QUOTE

***** "fluency" is an ill-defined construct in literature

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     Complicating matters further, reading researchers often refer to reading "fluency," a term theoretically distinct
from "automaticity" (Kuhn & Stahl, 2003; Wolf & Katzir-Cohen, 2001) but in practice greatly overlapping, because fluency
is difficult to assess out- side the domains of reading speed and accuracy.
     #+END_QUOTE

**** Automaticity and Obligatoriness in Stroop

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     MacLeod (1991) has reviewed the massive evidence from variants of this task and put a number of alternative
     hypothesis to the test of accounting for the data. Although none of the candidates was entirely successful, it
     seems that early notions of relative processing speed were inadequate, whereas the notion of automaticity was
     almost sufficient, especially in its modern, graded form (as opposed to the early binary distinction of controlled
     versus automatic processing). More recent proposals along the lines of parallel distributed processing seemed to
     fare best, as they apparently combine desirable aspects of both processing speed and an automaticity continuum.
     #+END_QUOTE

     ~reading the word is seen as obligatory, whereas naming the ink color is not~

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     reading is much more practiced than color naming and therefore reading dominates naming without regard for
     attention, causing interference. In support of this view, MacLeod and Dunbar (1988) tested the time course of
     interference as a function of practice for a new task (shape naming) and found a gradual reversal of the
     interference pattern, consistent both with a graded notion of automaticity and with the central role of relative
     automaticity in determining interference.
     #+END_QUOTE

***** assumption: practicing leads to automaticity
      
      the central hypothesis

      #+BEGIN_QUOTE
      practice on a task increases its speed of processing and allows it to interfere with tasks of lower processing
      speed. The more practiced tasks are then still the ones causing the most interference. Reading and naming are seen
      as differing only along a practice continuum, with no fundamental asymmetries related, e.g., to word-form encoding
      and production.
      #+END_QUOTE

**** Stroop interference in developing or poor readers

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     According to Samuels (1999), "poor readers who do not recognize words automatically find [the Stroop color-word test] to be an easy task" (p. 183)
     #+END_QUOTE

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     the pattern reported in the literature is that Stroop interference in children learning to read English increases over the course of grades 1-2 (Schiller, 1966) and then diminishes slowly into adulthood, to increase again after age 60 (Comalli, Wapner, & Werner, 1962).
     #+END_QUOTE

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     Turning to the performance of poor readers, who are not reading automatically, robust Stroop interference has been repeatedly reported (Alwitt, 1966; Everatt et al., 1997; Helland & Asbjørnsen, 2000; Kelly, Best, & Kirk, 1989; van der Schoot, Licht, Jorsley, & Sergeant, 2000). Moreover, Everatt et al. (1997) found more interference in children with dyslexia than in age-matched controls. Interestingly, in the study of Everatt et al. there was no diVerence in interference between children with dyslexia and reading-level matched, younger controls, suggesting that Stroop interference may be directly related to reading skill regardless of age or status of reading disability.

**** results: general population

     Multivariate data analysis procedures are not as robust to deviations from normality as ANOVA is. Therefore, after examining the detailed descriptive statistics, histograms, and Q-Q plots of all the variables, transformations were undertaken to approximate normal distributions for them. Generally, time measures required an inverse transformation whereas error measures required a square root transformation 
     #+END_QUOTE

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     relationship between interference and reading skills is a negative one: higher reading skills are associated with less Stroop interference.
     #+END_QUOTE

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     Neither age nor any of the intelligence-related measures are related to interference, thus a potential source of
uncontrolled complexity is removed
     #+END_QUOTE

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     Moderate correlations are obtained between color naming time (in the control XX condition) and all reading speed
     and accuracy measures. This is expected because naming speed is strongly related to reading ability, particularly
     to reading speed (Leinonen et al., 2001; van den Bos, Zijlstra, & van den Broeck, 2003; Wolf & Bowers, 1999). In
     fact this relation is sufficiently important that recent developments in reading disability indicate that a speed
     measure, as assessed by naming tasks, should be considered alongside phonological skills as a major contributing
     factor to reading skill development (or failure; hence the "double-deficit" theory of reading disability. See Wolf &
     Bowers, 1999; Wolf et al., 2002)

      #+BEGIN_QUOTE
      color-word naming interference is continuously negatively related to reading skills (better
reading, less interference). The strongest relation is with a straightforward decoding speed
measure, namely pseudoword read time, and this holds after partialling out the eVects of
baseline color naming speed

      #+END_QUOTE

      #+BEGIN_QUOTE
      these results are not consistent with the hypothesis that correlations of Stroop interference with error and time
      measures reflect a single, simpler underlying dimension of fluency only (i.e., of fast accurate reading). In
      contrast, it seems that interference receives independent contributions from both accuracy and speed
      #+END_QUOTE

***** vis-a-vis developmental / dysfunctional literature

      #+BEGIN_QUOTE
      results are also consistent with the developmental findings (Comalli et al., 1962) that interference decreases with age as children grow up from 7 to 20 years (as well as with the findings of Su, 1997, for picture-word naming interference from 2nd to 6th grade).
      #+END_QUOTE

      #+BEGIN_QUOTE
      because interference is obviously not possible in the absence of any reading ability, the increasing interference through school grades 1 and 2 (Schiller, 1966) most likely reflects the onset of reading, that is, emerging reading skills, and not the gradual attainment of adult fluency. The increased interference reported in old age (over 60 years) may correspond to an overall decrease in reading efficiency 
      #+END_QUOTE

      #+BEGIN_QUOTE
      Ehri and Wilce (1979) found that training recognition accuracy for unfamiliar words increases interference, whereas training recognition speed for familiar words decreases interference 
      #+END_QUOTE

      #+BEGIN_QUOTE
      Stanovich, Cunningham, and West (1981) likewise found increasing interference during the first 6 months of first grade, indicating emerging reading skills, but little further increase in the next 2 months. Presumably, had they continued testing through 3rd or 4th grade they would also have found decreasing interference associated with further automatization of reading skills. 
      #+END_QUOTE

***** Stroop and automaticity

      #+BEGIN_QUOTE
      Stroop interference is taken as an index of the "autonomy associated with automatic processing" (Logan, 1997, p. 126) and not of processing speed (cf. MacLeod, 1991). 
      #+END_QUOTE

      #+BEGIN_QUOTE
      In the context of the instance theory of automaticity (Logan, 1988), Stroop interference hinges on obligatory retrieval, that is, the assumption "that attention to an object or event is sufficient to cause things that were associated with it in the past to be retrieved from memory" (Logan, 1997, p. 131) 
      #+END_QUOTE

      #+BEGIN_QUOTE
      Alternatively, if a mechanism can be postulated to allow suppression of race winners based on task demands, then a
      possible course of processing might be as follows: as soon as obligatory retrieval is active, word reading
      dominates the naming task. Correct performance (color naming) is possible only to the extent that reading
      responses (which typically win the race) can be suppressed at the output stage. Because the response can be
      produced only after inappropriate candidates have been blocked, the time at which the appropriate (color naming)
      response can be selected cannot be earlier than the time at which the dominating (read word) response is
      suppressed. Therefore, slower word reading will lead to later suppression of the read response and later selection
      of the naming response; and thus to slower color naming in the incongruent condition, that is, greater
      interference. This account is similar to the one proposed by Miozzo and Caramazza (2003), where active blocking of
      distractors was hypothesized to explain the finding that distractor word interference in picture naming is
      inversely correlated to the frequency of the distractor.
      #+END_QUOTE

***** reduced inhibition

      #+BEGIN_QUOTE
      in the critical incongruent condition the distribution of participants over number of errors was statistically indistinguishable for the two groups (Table 2). In aging and demented populations, where increased interference is attributed to deficient inhibition, naming errors increase substantially along with increasing interference (Spieler et al., 1996).
      #+END_QUOTE

      #+BEGIN_QUOTE
      If the inhibition hypothesis is the correct explanation of increased interference, despite the lack of an effect on errors, then on the basis of these findings it would have to be expanded to encompass the general population. That is, poor executive inhibition should be found to be continuously associated with increased interference as well as with development of poor reading skills in the general, otherwise cognitively unimpaired, population, resulting in slow, inefficient reading. Whether a priori considered likely or not, and despite being at present less parsimonious than an account of interference that requires consideration of reading skill only, this is an empirically testable hypothesis, and one worth investigating further, in order to elucidate the role of attentional and executive factors of cognitive control in both reading performance and Stroop interference
      #+END_QUOTE

**** modeling & simulation

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     More recently, Roelofs (2003) has developed a model for the Stroop task based on a more general word production model (WEAVER++; Levelt, Roelofs, & Meyer, 1999). The basic assumption underlying this model is that word reading can directly activate both lemma retrieval and word-form encoding, whereas color naming must pass through conceptual identification before activating lemma retrieval and subsequently word-form encoding. 
     #+END_QUOTE

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     Word input ("reading") and color input (via conceptual activation) both contribute activation at the lemma level at which they may compete for selection. Lemma selection is determined by reference to the current task-dependent goal (e.g., "color naming") at a verification stage, so a lemma cannot be selected for response unless it matches the current goal regardless of how much it has been activated. The main diVerence between reading and color naming is the following: because word reading is inherently granted direct access to word forms, it can prevent activation of the word-form response that corresponds to the perceived color. In contrast, color naming cannot prevent activation of the lemma that corresponds to the written word but must wait until the incorrect response is suppressed by blocking rules that prevent goal-inappropriate responses and turn off goal-inappropriate stimulus input. Therefore, in this model, color-word Stroop interference is not so much a matter of experience as it is determined by a fundamental asymmetry between reading and concept naming. Crucially, because of this asymmetry, there is no reverse interference in the model (from an incongruent ink color to the word reading task).
     #+END_QUOTE

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     The way the /du/ parameter actually functions in the model is by setting the latency of a blocking rule (P3 in
     Roelofs, 2003). That is, lemmata are activated by their corresponding stimuli for an amount of time equal to /du/, at
     which point P3 applies and blocks the contribution of the task-inappropriate stimulus to lemma activation, thus
     allowing the activation of the task-appropriate (color naming) lemma to exceed the activation of the
     task-inappropriate (reading) one, eventually enabling correct lemma selection
     #+END_QUOTE

***** simulation 1 (a la Roelofs)

      #+BEGIN_QUOTE
      Because word stimuli activate word-form encoding directly, no time is spent on lemma retrieval for the reading task. In contrast, color naming must go through lemma retrieval on the basis of conceptual activation, which is why color naming is slower than word reading. When an incongruent word stimulus is present during the color naming task, then retrieval of the appropriate lemma takes even longer because the word activates an incorrect lemma for the duration of /du/. 
      #+END_QUOTE

      #+BEGIN_QUOTE
      blocking of word input depends on the latency of word form encoding (WFE), which is manipulated to simulate the slow reader, so that /du/ is a function of WFE
      #+END_QUOTE

      #+BEGIN_QUOTE
      after removing a few extreme outliers (two values at z > 4 not shown in the figure), the fit of a linear function (adjusted-R2 of .23 for control, .40 for incongruent, and .28 for interference) was within .02 of the best-fitting monotonic function, indicating that linearity constitutes a reasonable approximation for a wide range of reading performance. 
      #+END_QUOTE

      #+BEGIN_QUOTE
      even though naming speed for a variety of elements, including letters, digits, colors, and object drawings, is related to reading skill, it is the rapid naming of letters (and secondarily of digits) that is most impaired in poor readers (Wolf et al., 2002). Color naming, in particular, is sometimes found not to be strongly related to reading past the ages of the youngest readers (Semrud-Clikeman, Guy, & Griffin, 2000). The reason for these differences seems to lie in the shared cognitive processes (Wile & Borowsky, 2004) and corresponding brain circuits (Misra, Katzir, Wolf, & Poldrack, 2004) between the reading and rapid naming tasks 
      #+END_QUOTE

      #+BEGIN_QUOTE
      the effects of slow reading on color naming may be overestimated. The extent of the overestimate depends on the (unknown) relative contribution of letter-string processing and phonological processing to reading skill variance. 
      #+END_QUOTE

      #+BEGIN_QUOTE
      As a quantitative index of model fit we can calculate the ratio of the slopes: incongruent vs. reading over control vs. reading. This ratio expresses the relative influence of reading skill on the two color naming conditions. The ratio is 2.061 for the simple version of the model (/du/ depending on WFE only), 3.120 for the second version (with /du/ depending on WFE and LVIS in equal proportions) and 2.624 for the human data shown in Fig. 3. 
      #+END_QUOTE

      #+BEGIN_QUOTE
      even though individual letters can be named we have no reason to assume that there is an obligatory or well-practiced letter-naming process to interfere with color naming. In support of the latter assertion, Brown, Roos-Gilbert, & Carr (1995, Experiment 2) have found that rows of X's do not interfere with color naming, even though they produce Stroop dilution.

**** conclusion

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     We have presented evidence that greater Stroop interference is associated with lower reading skill. In particular, substantial proportions of interference variance can be attributed to decoding speed while additional unique variance is taken up by reading accuracy measures, after controlling for baseline color naming speed. We have interpreted these findings in the context of automatization as supporting a dissociation between obligatoriness and resource efficiency. To account for the effect, a blocking mechanism can be invoked, preventing dominant (obligatory) responses from being produced while allowing their processing speed to determine the non-dominant response latency.

*** Reading at "Impossible" Speeds

    G. Harry McLaughlin

    Spache simply quoted other researchers' data on the time required for the shortest effective fixation in reading (166
milliseconds), the time required for the saccade to the next fixation (33 milliseconds), and "the maximum number of
words that the eye can possibly see with a single fixation during continuous reading (probably 2.5 to 3 words)." Thus,
it appears, we can see only three words every fifth of a second, and, because there are 300 such intervals in a minute,
we can see only 3 x 300 = 900 words per minute. This must be the upper limit because it is difficult to sustain the rate
of five fixations a second.

**** instruments

***** electro-oculograph

      #+BEGIN_QUOTE
      The human eyeball appears to be charged electrically so that the retina is more negative than the cornea. By placing bipolar electrodes on the temples, it is possible to detect these charges and to use them for measuring horizontal eye movements (4). Thus, for example, when the eyes turn to the right, the electrode on the right temple becomes more positive and the left electrode becomes more negative. The potential change is reasonably proportional to angular movement of the eyeball. When the electrodes are connected to a suitable chart recorder, a graph showing horizontal eye movements plotted against time is obtained.
      Similarly, by placing bipolar electrodes just above and below one eye, it is possible to measure vertical eye movements. However, the vertical recording usually contains more noise and artifacts than the horizontal recording. A blink causes a strong vertical artifact, and the sensitivity is dependent somewhat on the height of opening of the eyelids. The timing information is, of course, still accurate.

      The reason for using the projector was that it obviated parallax errors when using an eye camera mounted on the subject's head. As explained in detail in Professor O'Beirne's technical note, this camera simultaneously photographed both a spot of light reflected from the eye, and the material which the subject was reading. This apparatus appears to have been used only once before to plot the eye movements of a speed reader (8): in that study the subject was found to deal with 10,000 words a minute by moving her eyes down the center of one page and up the center of the next one.

      #+BEGIN_QUOTE
      As for Miss L, she typically read a page of 260 words in 14 fixations distributed in a rough zig-zag down the page. Sometimes her gaze moved back up the page to make a flattened loop: she explained that she did this when she wished to see the same area twice. Electro-oculograms show that Miss L made similar eye movements when reading from the printed page. The photographic record shows that most of the fixations lasted 250 milliseconds and appeared steady.

***** ~A speed reader's behavior is similar in nearly all respects to that of a normal reader~

      Both make fixations of similar duration. The reason for this doubtless lies in the fact that the reticular formation appears to act as a gate to the brain: in any case there is a minimum time required to switch attention from one input to another. For auditory stimuli this has been found to be about 168 milliseconds (17). This is fascinatingly close to Spache's figure of 166 milliseconds for the minimum useful fixation in reading

***** "microsaccades"

      there may be some theory about different microsaccadic patterns in different readers

      #+BEGIN_QUOTE
      Microsaccades are eye movements which occur involuntarily to correct for the slow, tiny drifts of up to five
      minutes of arc which occur during prolonged fixation. Usually microsaccades do not occur until a fixation has
      continued for at least 200 milliseconds.  If one did occur during the normal reading fixation this would be
      disadvantageous because, as several recent quantitative studies have shown (e.g. 26) even the smallest involuntary
      eye movement is accompanied by a decrement in visual threshold and acuity for 50 milliseconds before and after the
      start of the movement. Unfortunately, this conjecture cannot yet be tested. The techniques available for measuring
      the large saccadic movements necessary in reading are still not sufficiently sensitive to detect microsaccades.
      #+END_QUOTE

      I'm convinced there is strong evidence that will show microsaccades are uninteresting for comprehension.

      #+BEGIN_QUOTE
      As Edfeldt has shown in a brilliant but too little known monograph (5), subvocalizing occurs whenever a reader, however good, slows down to study a difficult passage: evidently, among efficient readers at least, subvocalization is an effect not the cause of slow reading.

***** differences in eye movement patterns

      #+BEGIN_QUOTE
      The only essential objective difference between speed readers and other people is in their eye movement
      patterns. A normal reader or skimmer reads along a printed line; a speed reader follows a straight or zig-zag
      path, often moving from right to left and sometimes even going up the page. It is interesting to note that
      photographs of the eye movements of an eight-year-old boy prodigy showing just such ragged patterns were published
      in 1937, long before the current speed reading "fad" arose. The caption is as follows:

      "When his eye movements were photographed, he was in the ninth grade but was carrying tenth-grade mathematics
      successfully. His eye movements have been photographed thirteen different times, and all the records are somewhat
      similar to those shown . . . He reads backwards as well as forward, evidencing few of the characteristics usually
      associated with the . . . reading process. The rate of ... reading has varied from 646.15 words per minute to
      2,202.53 words per minute. During one period of photography lasting 44.91 seconds he averaged 853.71 words per
      minute with 100 per cent comprehension. At another time, for 9.8 seconds he average 1,989.79words per minute, with
      excellent comprehension. He evidently has an unusually large macular area which enables him to read with what has
      been termed a 'photographic eye'."

*** The Impact of the Spacing Effect and Overlearning on Student Performance in Calculus

    PhD dissertation by Nicholas Gorgievski

    compares massed (which carries an implication of overlearning in this paper) and cumulative (each new concept learned requires and builds upon a previous concept) practice and TA differences.

    The dissertation devotes a section to discussing the spacing effect, but this was, it seems, not actually manipulated, but like in the massed group, carries an assumption, in this case it is that "cumulative" is connected to "spacing". It's not a terrible assumption, but still does not connect cleanly to the concept that the title makes central.

    the paper shows a set delivery service used by the university called /WebAssign/, and it looks like a horrible way of learning high level math.

    The paper is summed up in the abstract, largely because it's a report on a series of null results:

    #+BEGIN_QUOTE
    The findings showed that there were no statistical differences on final exam scores between the participants in the massed and cumulative groups. Additionally, the 50% increase in the number of homework problems per set did not show statistical differences in student performance as measured on final exam scores.
    #+END_QUOTE

    One important thing is the subjects were mostly students in STEM fields and had to pass a calculus test to be in the class that was used as the subject pool. So it's likely that they're all pretty /smart/ already. I couldn't find anything about ratings on teaching assistants or other information about the specific differences between then, except that they were different, but the SDs are high enough that it's probably not going to account for much in this cohort.

    So consequently this paper, regardless of the final test scores, is basically explainable with "gold in, gold out", and does not illuminate anything about a possible lead-to-gold transformation process of any degree or any different efficiency.

     found at a 6-month post-intervention followup with no social contact in between.

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     The results of this single-blind randomized controlled trial showed convincing immediate beneficial effects of a daily training program involving reading and solving arithmetic problems on the speed of processing (as measured by DST) and executive function (as measured by FAB) that are not directly tied to the intervention. Such improvements were maintained 6 months after the training.
     #+END_QUOTE

     By changes in the DST, they conclude:

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     Since perceptual speed and working memory are not directly trained by our intervention, our results support evidence of the improvement in non-targeted cognitive functions
     #+END_QUOTE

     I am not yet familiar with the DST. It is plausibly a DLPFC-targeting task. This conclusion is flawed though,
     because working memory maintenance does involve DLPFC.

     The other problem with this investigation is that while the findings are fine, the intervention is essentially the
     same as "keeping an active mind". What we see here gives support to the folk belief mentioned in the intro,

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     People generally believe the so-called mental-exercise hypothesis, that is, the age-related decline in cognitive function is less pronounced for people who are mentally active, yet there is insufficient scientific evidence supporting this hypothesis.
     #+END_QUOTE

     which is a good thing. However, the purported transfer effects are much more restricted than ~cognitive functions~
     leads the casual reader to thing. Simple arithmetic, aside of working memory, is highly predicated on a "table
     lookup" task, akin to an object naming task. Arguing that observing more efficient frontal control associated with
     that kind of table lookup is evidence of cognitive transfer is highly suspect.

     One can just as validly claim that this study supports the use of first grade homework as mental stimulation
     exercises for the elderly. It is much worse of a paper heading, but is just as true.

      memory for novel shapes and spatial frequency shows no decay over retention intervals of 8--10 sec but decay after
      that, whereas memory for contrast decreases linearly with retention
      interval [fn:magnussenetal1996] [fn:sakaietal2002]. These findings suggest that the decay, and hence the fidelity,
      of memory representations are stimulus dependent.

*** Brain Activity in Valuation Regions while Thinking about the Future Predicts Individual Discount Rates
    
    Cooper et al 2013

    #+BEGIN_QUOTE
    Steep discounters tended to have larger neural responses [in VMPFC and striatum] when judging short delays than when judging long delays, while shallow discounters tended to have the opposite pattern. Our results show that prompting someone to think about the future, in a fairly minimal manner with no mention of outcomes, elicits brain activity that predicts discount rates.
    #+END_QUOTE

    this actually confounds the interpretation

    #+BEGIN_QUOTE
    Here we show that the delay sensitivity of VS and VMPFC BOLD responses when individuals make simple value-free judgments about the subjective length of future time intervals predicts behavioral discount rates measured 10 d later. This suggests that the association between neural activity and discounting arises from a basic process involved in thinking about the future, such as judging temporal distance.
    #+END_QUOTE

    the problem is that thinking about a future time is itself a complex process. the resulting difference in brain activity is satisfactorily demonstrated but we cannot claim anything about the comparability of "thinking about the future" and "discounting", merely the resultant activity is similar in these regions.

    #+BEGIN_QUOTE
    In this context, the 15% of the variance in discount rates that can be accounted for by neural delay sensitivities is a sizable and important effect.
    #+END_QUOTE

    And so one could expect a greater variance explainable when we tease apart what is going on during thinking about the future. It may even turn out to be the exact same kind of valuation process. This point is mentioned in the discussion.

**** discounting

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     Neuroimaging studies of discounting have found that BOLD activity in ventral striatum (VS) and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) scales with the subjective value of the options being considered (Kable and Glimcher, 2007, 2010; Ballard and Knutson, 2009; Peters and Büchel, 2009; Pine et al., 2009).
     #+END_QUOTE

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     In high discounters, there is much greater activity in these regions for immediate compared with equally sized delayed rewards, while this difference is smaller in low discounters.
     #+END_QUOTE

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     Hariri et al. (2006) have shown that higher discounters exhibit a greater VS response to unpredicted rewards. Others have shown that higher discounters exhibit a greater difference in BOLD activity between judgments of oneself in the present compared with the future (Ersner-Hershfield et al., 2009; Mitchell et al., 2011).
     #+END_QUOTE

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     Previous work has shown that discount rates vary widely across individuals, and that these differences are relatively stable across time (Ohmura et al., 2006; Kirby, 2009; Senecal et al., 2012).
     #+END_QUOTE

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     there are surprisingly few reliable predictors of discount rates. Perhaps the strongest is cognitive ability, which is reliably associated with discount rates with an effect size of approximately r = -0.20 (Shamosh and Gray, 2008; Burks et al., 2009).
     #+END_QUOTE

**** methods

     prepaid debit cards is a good payment method

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     All payments were made using prepaid debit cards, as described previously (Kable and Glimcher, 2007, 2010). These cards have the advantage of making receipt of the delayed payment easy and reliable, minimizing the effects of greater uncertainty about and effort needed for the future reward.
     #+END_QUOTE

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     In the time discounting task, we characterized the relationship between the objective delay (OT) and the participant's evaluation of $75 received after that delay (BID). We fit this relationship with the following function: BID = 75/(1 + k x OT); Mazur, 1987).
     #+END_QUOTE

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     The first model for the temporal judgments task included 15 covariates of interest. These covariates modeled activity at the following three different time points in the trial: (1) the time at which a trial began and participants saw the delay to be judged (Qon); (2) the time at which the response bar appeared and the participant could begin entering the response (Ron); and (3) the time at which the participant submitted the response (Roff).
     #+END_QUOTE

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     All of these covariates were constructed by convolving a delta function at the time of each event (i.e., only the first 100 ms of each event is modeled) with an empirically estimated hemodynamic response function. This hemodynamic response function is distributed with the VoxBo software package and was empirically estimated by Aguirre et al. (1998) from motor cortex responses during a motor performance task.
     #+END_QUOTE
     
**** results

     the finding is essentially the tagline in the abstract. The relationship is not going to be linear in reality (since one could project to arbitrarily longer future delays), but the directional relationship is clear enough.

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     on the delay being judged (delays were divided into 13 bins). High discounters showed a higher response in both ventral striatum and ventromedial prefrontal cortex to short delay periods that decreased as delay lengths increased (Fig. 2). Low discounters showed the opposite pattern, with responses increasing from short delays to long delays (Fig. 2).
     #+END_QUOTE

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     Using the AUC estimation of discount rates, which allows us to include all participants, this relationship is just as strong (ventral striatum: r(38) = 0.44, p = 0.0049; ventromedial prefrontal cortex: r(38) = 0.34, p = 0.0314; note that larger AUC corresponds to less discounting). Higher discounters showed an increasingly negative relationship between BOLD activity and objective durations, while lower discounters had an  increasingly positive relationship.
     #+END_QUOTE

     
**** interpretation

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     People might directly use their evaluation of future reward as a cue for judging the length of a future duration. Or, they might imagine a specific future event when judging duration. Cues in the simulated future event might be used to judge temporal distance, and the same simulated event might also be automatically evaluated.
     #+END_QUOTE

     while that helps qualify the ensuing interpretations, this was still a stretch

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     the correlations between BOLD activity and individual differences in behavior can be comparable to or even outperform those of standard psychometric variables.
     #+END_QUOTE
     
     They unfortunately didn't probe or didn't report on what the subjects generally think about when self-projecting into the future. If the activity is driven by the /type/ of thought, then the striatal activation should be downstream of the actual region responsible for the observed impatience. If this were a downstream effect, i.e. we are seeing the result of valuation, presumably the psychometrics would be targeting something more upstream. They provide a more precise measure, but localizing on valuation regions would be like catching a rat by placing a trap in its tracks, instead of following its scent to its nest.

     If on the other hand the future valuation /is/ done in these regions, that's a different story, but it seems highly unlikely that gravity of the /planning/ process resides in these regions.

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     Given that ventromedial prefrontal cortex has been linked to a "prospective brain network" that simulates the future (Buckner and Carroll, 2007; Gilbert and Wilson, 2007; Schacter et al., 2007) and to predicting the subjective value of different possible actions during decision making (Kable and Glimcher, 2009; Rangel and Hare, 2010)
     #+END_QUOTE

     so if we're seeing a downstream effect, then the "novel psychologicla interventions" would probably work in aggregate but come with a lot of noise.

17:18 the public responds to precedents and superlatives. So, we're the first life on mars, the farthest that life's ever traveled, and you have this money shot of green plants on a red background. So, that seemed like it would get people pretty excited.

34:00 the nature of new technology adoption is it tends to follow an S-curve. so what usually happens is people underpredict in the beginning, because people tend to extrapolate on a straight line, and then they will overpredict it kind of at the midpoint because there's late adopters, and it will actually take longer than people think at the midpoint, but much shorter than people think at the beginning.

** QA 1: on startups and profits

   a lot of times people think creating companies is gonna be fun.

   i would say it's really not that fun. there are periods of fun, and there are periods where it's just awful.

   and particularly if you're the CEO of the company, you actually have a distillation of all the worst problems in the company. there's no point in spending your time on things that are going right, so you're only spending your time on things that are going wrong.

   and there are things that are going wrong that other people can't take care of. so you have like the worst -- you have a filter for the crappest problems in the company. the most pernicious and painful problems.

   ... when you come up with a new technology, it should feel like that. if you told it to an objective person, would they look forward to the day that that thing became available.

** perspective, vision matters
   
   16:28
   
   We were in 1993 the only consumer 3D graphics company in the world.
   
   Silicon Graphics up the street was the professional -- if you will -- 3D graphics company. By the end of a couple of years or so -- 1995 -- there were probably 50, 70 startups doing exactly the same thing that we were trying to do. And over time, we competed without about 200 companies. NVidia today is the only surviving computer graphics company in the world. And so the question is then, what happened?

   Competition is intense. Everybody has smart people. Everybody has money.

   ...

   I would argue that 300 companies, armed with exactly the same technology, armed with exactly the same people, the company that wins... and lets say the all execute. And they did. With 300 companies, 50% of them were gonna execute at any given point in time. And so the question is, why does one survive.

   Well, I think it matters to have perspective.

   ...

   I always believed that you need to understand the reason why your business works. What is the essence of your business? Why does it work?

   

** Moore's law

   "is a law of setting pace"
   
** when your customers all tell you not to do something... what do you do?

   because we had this unique perspective that 3D graphics was insatiable, and Moore's Law was our friend, therefore, we should make our graphics processesors twice as good every year.

   "we're going to ignore customers"

   -- the customers don't know the nature of the business. there's no common sense

** what happens when your product becomes "good enough"

   22:03

   "The programmable shader"

   3d graphics was not going to be sustainable as a accelerator, or fixed function device, that renders texture maps and polygons on the screen.

   we had to change the company to make the 3d graphics processors programmable to be an artistic medium of expression

   24:00
   
   the crossing from one generation of technology to the next generation almost killed the company

** dying at the rate of Moore's Law

   when you're in a technology industry, when the technology moves this fast, the if you're not reinventing yourself, you're just slowly dying, unfortunately, at the rate of Moore's Law.

** cannibalizing your own products

   so we have a product that's generating a lot of money, and it's very successful, how do you cannibalize it?

** developing a tolerance for failure

   I don't believe you can fundamentally say that you want, as a CEO, to nurture the spirit of innovation, to encourage innovation, unless you have a culture of risk taking

   we have to encourage our engineers, our marketing people, all of our employees, to take calculated risks. In order to encourage them to take calculated risks, first of all you have to teach them. that's a skill. a matter of skill. then the second part is a matter of courage.

   

** you must keep reinventing the company

   the biggest challenge with building a company is the reinvention of the company.

   every successful thing needs to be torn down at some point and be rebuilt. it
   is unfortunate but true. and the reason for that is because the technology
   either gets good enough, and therefore you have to reinvent. and sometimes the
   invention process is disruptive. sometimes it is in fact destructive. it could
   destroy what you have built in the past.

** as the ceo

   you're either making money, saving money, or raising money

   as a startup you're always going out of business. that's the definition of a startup! an enterprise that is nearly out of business all the time.



   
   



* on reading

** clues

** why late L2 learners never seem to correct their accents

** why it is easy to correct reading errors in L1

   but is this the same as correcting an accent? if pre- and post- correction all reside within the familiar phoneme
   space, then it isn't a correction in accent. Nevertheless, rapid correction of an error that has reached habit
   status is likely a fundamentally different kind of memory change than a mere paired associate of orthography to
   phonology.

** TODO comprehension of text involving cross-modal conversion

   where modality is not simply a description of a sensory mode, but 1. varying levels of abstraction; 2. varying
   cognitive pathways.

   a very clear case of this is the mapping of pure verbal descriptions to pure math. i.e., describing a formula in
   plain text: "the performance score is a function of time spent, such that each 3 second increment in time spent
   leads to a 1 percent increase in score". This is more concisely, and clearly, stated as
   
   =score.point = 1/3 * second.spent=

   there is no more to be gained from any linguistic embellishment of the concept, though one could arbitrarily
   embellish the concept and elongate its reading time.

   another example is the description of information presented in a tabular form. "R = bell right or shock right", etc.
   this case is obvious becuase the description is devoid of context until one sees the table.

   another example is spatial description. John sits to the right of Charles, who is 2 seats away from Sally, etc. This
   engages visuospatial processes. This is often quite easy, but is possible that this depends very highly on
   facilitation based on personal experiences. E.g., if one is familiar with groups sitting at round or rectangular
   tables, it may be easier; it is easier, because one efficiently accesses relevant memories, and subconsciously uses
   the method of loci in processing the text. Aside of that though, the speed of invocation of the method of loci here
   is of interest.

   So we want list all different kinds of conversions in text. Then categorize them on axes of abstractness and
   modality, and find out what predicts difficulty. Another interesting question is how to characterize these
   sentences, because some may not have a modality before successful decoding of the text post-orthography, like a garden
   path sentence, where each word is deciphered, but the sentence has little meaning until it is fully deciphered, THEN
   we have a modality. So modality is a higher level process, but it probably has the greatest variance.
